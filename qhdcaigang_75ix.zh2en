彩钢夹芯板主要应用于工业厂房、仓库的屋面和外墙。过去的工业厂房屋面多采用预制混凝土板或石棉板。随着轻钢结构的迅速推广，夹芯板也以其多项显著的优势取代了上述2种材料。	Color steel sandwich panels are mainly used in industrial buildings, roofs and external walls of warehouses. In the past, prefabricated concrete boards or asbestos boards were used in the roofs of industrial buildings. With the rapid expansion of the light steel structure, the 2 kinds of materials have been replaced by the sandwich panels with a number of significant advantages.
在提供更好隔热效果的同时，夹芯板配合已成熟发展的轻钢结构，能够真正体现轻钢体系轻质、快速高效、布置灵活等一系列优势，因而在目前的单层厂房建筑中已成为首选的方案。	While providing better insulation effect, sandwich panels, combined with the developed lightweight steel structure, can truly represent a series of advantages such as lightweight, fast and efficient layout and flexible layout of light steel system, so it has become the first choice in the current single story factory building.
PE涂料对于材质有良好的附着性，彩涂钢板易于加工成型，价廉且产品多，颜色和光泽的选择余地大。聚酯涂料对耐紫外光性与涂膜耐粉化性，并不理想，因此PE涂料的使用仍需受到一些限制，一般用在空气污染不严重的地区或需多次成型加工的产品。	PE coating has good adhesion to materials, color coated steel plate is easy to process and shape, low price and many products, and there is a wide choice of color and luster. Polyester coating is not ideal for UV resistance and powdering resistance of film. Therefore, the use of PE coating still needs to be restricted. It is generally used in areas where air pollution is not serious or products that need to be molded for many times.
硅改性聚酯	SMP,Silicone Mobified Polyester
由于聚酯含有活性基-OH/-COOH，极易和其它高分子化和物反应，为改良PE的耐阳光性与粉化性，以色泽保持性与耐热性优的Silicone树脂作变性反保定平面设计培训 保定空调维修 保定管道通风 包装盒定做 化粪池模具 废旧电缆回收 不锈钢铸件 应，和PE的变性比可于5%—50%之间，SMP提供钢板更好的持久性，其防蚀年限可长达10-12年，当然其价格也比较PE为高，但因Silicone树脂对材质的附着性和加工成型性并不理想，因此SMP彩涂钢板并不适用于需多次成型加工的场合，大部分用于建筑屋顶及外墙。	Because polyester contains active group - OH / - COOH, it is easy to react with other macromolecules and substances. In order to improve the sunlight resistance and powdering property of PE, silicone resin with excellent color retention and heat resistance is used for denaturation reaction, and the denaturation ratio of PE can be between 5% - 50%. SMP provides better durability of steel plate, and its anti-corrosion life can be as long as 10-12 years. Of course, its price is higher than that of PE The adhesion and processability of e resin to the material are not ideal. Therefore, SMP color coated steel sheet is not suitable for the occasions requiring multiple molding and processing, and most of them are used for building roofs and external walls.
高耐侯聚酯	HDP、High durable Polyster
低层别墅的屋面大都为坡屋面，因此屋面结构基本上采用的是由冷弯型彩钢钢构件做成的三角型屋架体系，轻钢构件在封完结构性板材及石膏板之后，形成了非常坚固的"板肋结构体系"，这种结构体系有着更强的抗震及抵抗水平荷载的能力，适用于抗震烈度为8度以上的地区。	Most of the roofs of low rise villas are sloping roofs. Therefore, the roof structure basically adopts the triangular roof truss system made of cold-formed color steel members. After sealing the structural plates and gypsum boards, the light steel components form a very solid "plate rib structure system". This structure system has stronger seismic resistance and horizontal load resistance, and is suitable for seismic intensity of 8 degrees On the district.
抗风性	Wind resistance
彩钢钢结构建筑重量轻、强度高、整体刚性好、变形能力强。建筑物自重仅是砖混结构的五分之一，可抵抗每秒70米的飓风，保定平面设计培训 保定空调维修 保定管道通风 包装盒定做 化粪池模具 废旧电缆回收 不锈钢铸件 使生命财产能得到有效的保护。	The color steel structure building has the advantages of light weight, high strength, good overall rigidity and strong deformation ability. The self weight of the building is only one fifth of that of the brick concrete structure, which can resist the hurricane of 70 meters per second, so that life and property can be effectively protected.
彩钢板活动房的一般寿命多少年？	How many years is the general life of color steel plate activity room?
彩钢板的使用寿命大约为20年。	The service life of color steel plate is about 20 years.
彩钢房是以彩钢复合板为墙体，以轻钢结构为骨架搭建而成。通常情况下，彩色镀锌钢板防腐层的保质期在10-15年，面漆在10-15年没有大的褪色，所以寿命在正常情况下可以超过10-15年。但是彩钢房的寿命也与环境、使用材料的质量和保养的方式有关。	The color steel house is built with color steel composite board as wall and light steel structure as framework. In general, the shelf life of the anticorrosive coating of color galvanized steel sheet is 10-15 years, and the top coat does not fade greatly in 10-15 years, so the service life can exceed 10-15 years under normal circumstances. But the life of color steel room is also related to the environment, the quality of materials used and the way of maintenance.
总的来说，彩钢板经久耐用流水槽钢模具 不锈钢铸件 扭王字块模具 井盖钢模具 标志桩模具 调匝式消弧线圈 风冷控制柜 烤漆龙骨，多种研究显示，经特殊涂层处理的夹芯彩钢板保质期在10-15年，以后每隔10年喷防腐涂料，板材的寿命可达35年以上。	In general, the color steel plate is durable. Many studies show that the shelf life of the sandwich color steel plate treated with special coating is 10-15 years. After spraying anti-corrosion coating every 10 years, the service life of the plate can reach more than 35 years.
在选择彩钢板时，需要选择质量性能优异的材料。由于夏天梅雨季节，彩钢板很容易受到雨水出现腐蚀情况，所以也要注意保养。1-2年刷涂保养油漆一次，这样既可以防止钢架生锈，又可以延长其使用寿命和保持美观。	In the selection of color steel plate, it is necessary to select the material with excellent quality and performance. Due to the plum rain season in summer, the color steel plate is easy to be corroded by rain, so attention should be paid to maintenance. Brush the maintenance paint once every 1-2 years, which can not only prevent the steel frame from rusting, but also prolong its service life and maintain its beauty
钢结构施工工程资料怎么做？	How to do steel structure construction engineering data?
1、要切实作好钢结构制作及安装单位的考察与选择工作	1. It is necessary to do a good job in the investigation and selection of steel structure fabrication and installation units
我们知道，钢结构工程的施工要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，这两个阶段可由一个施工单位完成，但有时也可能由两个单位分别完成（分包）。	As we know, the construction of steel structure engineering should go through two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. These two stages can be completed by one construction unit, but sometimes it may be completed by two units separately (subcontracting).
切实作好钢结构制作单位和安装单位的考察与选择工作，对于确保钢结构工程质量及进度，具有重要意义。	It is of great significance for ensuring the quality and progress of steel structure engineering to do a good job in the investigation and selection of steel structure manufacturing and installation units.
钢结构制作、安装单位的考察内容主要有：企业资质，生产规模，技术人员数量、职称及履历，技术工人数量及资格证，机械设备情况，以及业绩情况等级。	The inspection contents of steel structure manufacturing and installation units mainly include: enterprise qualification, production scale, number of technical personnel, professional title and resume, number and qualification certificate of technical workers, mechanical equipment and performance level.
2、严格审查承包单位提交的钢橡胶托辊 槽型托辊 皮带托辊 平行托辊 保定搬家 保定搬家电话 保定搬家公司 保定搬家 铜鼎 铜狮子 结构制作工艺及安装施工组织设计	2. Strictly review the steel structure manufacturing process and installation construction organization design submitted by the contractor
施工组织设计是承包单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，认真审查施工组织设计是监理工作事前控制和主动控制的重要内容。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document prepared by the contractor to guide all activities in the whole process of project construction. Careful examination of construction organization design is an important content of pre control and active control of supervision work.
集装箱活动房安装的误区	Misconceptions in installation of container movable rooms
大家在安装集装箱活动房的时候，一定要注意这几大误区：	When installing container activities rooms, we must pay attention to these misunderstandings.
误区1：彩钢房檩条设计尺寸与安装尺寸实际不符，对于集装箱房安装过程中与设计方案尺寸不符，平时不要小看这个安装细节，安装不好轻则对屋面板变型，重则对房屋倒塌，	Mistake 1: Color steel house purlins design size and installation size does not conform to the actual, for the container room installation process and design plan size does not conform to the usual installation details, do not underestimate this installation, installation is not good light on the roof deck deformation, heavy on the collapse of the house.

误区2：盲目的用材	Myth 2: blind timber
工程进场，起初基础刚刚做好，就大量的将材料运进工地，易造成安装不便、材料多少也会沾上泥巴，造成起初预备的材料进场方案。	As soon as the foundation is finished, a large number of materials will be transported to the site, which will easily cause inconvenience in installation and mud on the amount of materials, resulting in the initial preparation of the material admission scheme.
广泛运用到我们的生活中，主要原因还是在于彩涂板具有良好的防腐蚀性能，而且易于加工改造，比其他材质的板材都要轻，所以彩涂板才会在建筑市场上受到极大的重视。那么，彩涂板是什么以及彩涂板市场用途是什么呢?我们一起来看看吧。	Widely used in our life, the main reason is that the color coating plate has good corrosion resistance, and easy to process and transform, lighter than the other materials, so color coating plate will be paid great attention to in the building market.

彩涂板适用于多的领域，包括建筑、家电和交通运输三部分。在建筑领域，因为彩涂板涂层钢板具有轻质、美观和防腐蚀性能，所以它被广泛用于建造钢结构厂房、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶和墙面。在家电领域，彩涂板蠕动泵 保定建筑设计 保定网站建设 保定网站制作 保定网络公司 保定办公家具 保定轻钢别墅用于生产冰箱、微波炉等家电的表面。在交通运输方面，彩涂板被应用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等方面的生产，加工。	Color coated panels are applied to many fields, including building, household appliances and transportation three parts. In the field of architecture, color coated plate coated steel plates are lightweight, beautiful and anticorrosive, so it is widely used to build roofs and walls of industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, storeroom, freezers, and so on. In the field of household appliances, color coated boards are used to produce the surface of household appliances such as fridge and microwave oven. In transportation, color coated panels are applied to the production and processing of oil pan, automotive interior parts and so on.
钢结构制作工程质量控制	Quality control of steel construction engineering
钢结构工程的施工通常要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段。钢结构工程有大部分时间是在工厂车间内部进行，由于钢结构构件在工厂内加工制造的质量好坏，对钢结构工程的现场安装及整体结构的安全稳定至关重要。因此钢结构制作生产厂家必须具备相应企业资质、生产规模、技术能力、机械设备及先进的工艺水平。	The construction of steel structure usually has two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. The steel structure works most of the time in the factory workshop, because the quality of the steel structure components manufacturing in the factory is very important to the site installation and the safety and stability of the overall structure of the steel structure engineering. Therefore, manufacturers of steel structure must have corresponding qualification, production scale, technical capability, mechanical equipment and advanced technological level.
钢结构一般制作工艺流程分为:放样→下料→拼板→切割→组立→埋弧焊接→钻孔→组装→矫正成型→铆工零配件下料→制作组装→焊接和焊接检验→防锈处理、涂装、编号→构件验收出厂。在钢结构制作中，应根据钢结构制作工艺流程，抓住关键工序进行质量控制，如控制关键零件的加工，主要构件的工艺、措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	The general production process of steel structure is divided into three parts: layout, blanking, cutting board, cutting, assembling, submerged arc welding, drilling, assembling, correction forming, riveting and assembling, making and assembling, welding and welding inspection, rust prevention treatment, painting, numbering and acceptance of the factory. In the production of steel structure, the process flow should be made according to the steel structure, and the quality control is carried out by the key process, such as the processing of the key parts, the process and measures of the main components, the processing equipment and the process equipment.
重视焊接工程质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of welding engineering
在钢结构制作和安装工程工程中焊接工程是最重要的环节，必须重视焊接工程质量控制。目前，钢结构在生产过程中大部分采用具自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，个别部位采用手工施焊。	Welding engineering is the most important part in the fabrication and installation of steel structures, and the quality control of welding engineering must be emphasized. At present, most of the steel structures are equipped with automatic submerged arc welding machines, partly equipped with semi automatic gas shielded welding machines, and some parts are manually welded.
焊接质量问题较多存在于手工焊缝，这些问题有：焊瘤、夹渣、气孔、没焊透、咬边、错边、焊缝尺寸偏差大、不用引弧板、焊接变形不矫正、飞溅物清理白钢雕塑 小型滚揉机 防火电缆 托辊设备 水刀切割机  铜钟 石雕狮子  校园不锈钢雕塑 扭王块模具不净等。鉴于这种情况，钢结构施焊前，对焊条的合格证要进行检查，按说明书要求使用，焊工必须持证上岗证，焊缝表面不得有裂纹	There are many problems of welding quality in hand weld, such as welding, slag, gas hole, no penetration, bite, wrong side, large deviation of weld size, no arc plate, no correction of welding deformation and clean spatter. In view of this situation, before the steel structure is welded, the qualification certificate for the welding rod should be checked, and the welder must be certificated with the certificate, and there shall be no cracks on the surface of the weld
彩钢门窗的原材料是彩色镀锌钢板，所以彩钢门窗具有很高的强度和很好的耐腐蚀性能。彩钢门窗是用彩板为原材料制作而成的，有着极强的耐候性。彩钢门窗安装白钢雕塑 小型滚揉机 防火电缆 托辊设备 水刀切割机  铜钟 石雕狮子  校园不锈钢雕塑 扭王块模具在建筑物上一般可与建筑物同等寿命。	The raw material of color steel doors and windows is color galvanized steel plate, so color steel doors and windows have high strength and good corrosion resistance. Color steel doors and windows are made of color plate as raw materials, with strong weather resistance. Color steel doors and windows installed on the building can generally have the same life as the building
彩钢板保温隔热	Color steel insulation
彩钢板复合板常用保温材料有：岩棉、玻璃纤维棉、聚苯乙烯（EPS）、聚氨酯等，导热系数低，从而活动房具有良好保温隔热效果。高强度彩钢板采用高强度钢板为基材（抗张拉强度5600kg/cm）再加上最先进的设计与滚压成型。因此彩钢板活动房具有极佳的结构特性。	The common thermal insulation materials of color steel plate composite board are rock wool, glass fiber cotton, polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane, etc., with low thermal conductivity, so the movable room has good thermal insulation effect.

4、彩钢板的表面状态可以分成涂层板、压花板、印花板。	4. The surface state of color steel plate can be divided into coating plate, embossing plate and printing plate.
5、彩涂钢板市场用途主要分为建筑、家电和交通运输等三部分，其中建筑领域所占比例最大，家电业次之，交通运输业只占较少一部分。	5. The market uses of color-coated steel sheet are mainly divided into three parts: construction, household appliances and transportation, among which the construction sector accounts for the largest proportion, followed by household appliances industry, and transportation industry only accounts for a small part.
建筑用彩钢板一般以热镀锌钢板和热镀铝锌钢板为基板，主要加工成瓦楞板或与聚氨酯复合夹芯板后，用于建造钢结构厂房、机场、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶、墙面、门。	Hot-dip galvanized steel sheet and hot-dip aluminized galvanized steel sheet are generally used as the base plate for building. After being processed into corrugated sheet or polyurethane composite sandwich board, they are used to build roofs, walls and doors of industrial and commercial buildings such as steel structure factory buildings, airports, warehouses, refrigerators, etc.
家电彩板一般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，用于生产冰箱和大型空调系统，冰柜、面包机、家具等。交通运输业上一般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，主要用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等。	Household appliances are generally based on galvanized and cold plates, which are used to produce refrigerators and large air conditioning systems, freezers, bread machines, furniture, etc. Transportation industry generally uses galvanized and cold plate as the base plate, mainly used for oil pan, automotive interiors and so on
主要机组	Main units
上个世纪80年代末我国才陆续建设彩钢板机组，这些机组多建在钢铁厂及合资企业，彩钢板工艺设备基本从国外引进。到2000年国产彩钢板达到173万吨，出现了产能过剩。国有特大钢铁企业的机组产能、装备水平较高，都相继建成了采用国外技术、年生产能力12万～17万吨的彩钢板机组。	At the end of the 1980s, color steel plate mills were built one after another in China. Most of these mills were built in iron and steel plants and joint ventures. The color steel plate process equipment was basically imported from abroad. By 2000, the domestic color steel plate reached 1.73 million tons, resulting in overcapacity. The production capacity and equipment level of the units in the state-owned super-large iron and steel enterprises are relatively high. The color steel plate units with overseas technology and annual production capacity of 120,000-170,000 tons have been built successively.
同时，许多民营企业投资的彩钢板生产大多采用国产设备，产能较小，但上马快、投资低，产品主要面向建材、装饰行业。另外，外资、台资也纷纷登陆兴建彩涂机组，但大部分集中在沿海地区。1999年以来，随着彩涂板市场兴旺，彩涂板的生产及消费进入了快速增长期。从2000～2004年，生产量以平均39.0%的速度递增。到2005年止，全国彩涂板产能大于800万吨/年，还有一批彩涂机组正在建设之中，全国总产能超过900万吨/年。	At the same time, many private enterprises invest in color steel plate production mostly using domestic equipment, production capacity is small, but fast start, low investment, products mainly for building materials, decoration industry. In addition, foreign capital and Taiwanese capital have also landed to build color painting units, but most of them are concentrated in coastal areas. Since 1999, with the flourishing market of color coated panels, the production and consumption of color coated panels have entered a period of rapid growth. From 2000 to 2004, production increased at an average rate of 39.0%. By 2005, the national production capacity of color coated sheets was more than 8 million tons per year, and a number of color coated units were under construction, with a total production capacity of more than 9 million tons per year.
彩钢设备由放料、成型、后成型切割组成，生产出的产品广泛应用于工业民用建筑，如厂房、仓库、体育馆、展览馆、影剧院等房面和墙体，作为大型机械设备，主要原材料为钢铁，因此不会像很多客户想象的那样不堪一击，频繁出现故障，根据对老客户的回访总结，在压瓦机设备的使用过程当中有以下两点是较容易出现故障的地方。电脑控制系统：对于电脑控制系统的故障一般情况下都是因为操作不当产生的，设备售出我们会有专门的技术人员上门为客户安装调试并教会客户如何去操作，然而，避免不了生手也就是未经过我技术人员培训的人员去操作设备，因此会导致设备电脑控制系统的程序故障；液压泵站故障：液压泵站控制着彩钢压瓦机设备的剪切系统，随着生产时间的增加会出现液压泵站不过油或者是不过电的情况，多半是由于电磁阀接触不良抑或是液压油质量的问题。	Color steel equipment is composed of discharging, forming and post forming cutting. The products produced are widely used in industrial and civil buildings, such as workshops, warehouses, gymnasiums, exhibition halls, cinemas and other rooms and walls. As a large-scale mechanical equipment, the main raw material is steel, so it will not be as vulnerable as many customers imagine, and frequent failures occur As a result, the following two points are prone to failure during the use of tile press equipment. However, our customers will not be able to operate the computer control system by hand, which will lead to the failure of the control system Sequence failure; hydraulic pump station fault: the hydraulic pump station controls the shearing system of color steel tile press equipment. With the increase of production time, there will be no oil or electricity in the hydraulic pump station, which is mostly due to the poor contact of solenoid valve or the quality of hydraulic oil.
彩钢围挡是施工现场采用的围护结构，彩钢围挡具有款式新颖，品种齐全，耐腐蚀和耐候等特性，彩钢围挡的款式也可根据施工需要进行定做，彩钢围挡由钢结构柱组成，双面夹层彩钢板或单层彩钢板通过螺栓连接，与彩钢围挡固定在地基上，用于临时工地的隔离。	The color steel fence is the enclosure structure used in the construction site. The color steel fence has the characteristics of novel style, complete variety, corrosion resistance and weather resistance. The style of the color steel fence can also be customized according to the construction needs. The color steel fence is composed of steel structure columns. The double-sided sandwich color steel plate or single-layer color steel plate is connected with the color steel fence through bolts, and is fixed on the foundation for temporary site isolation 。
小项目也必须要设有彩钢围挡，由于彩钢围挡可以将建筑工地与外界隔开，出于安全考虑，这道屏障主要设在建筑工地附近，因此，我们经常看到工地附近有彩钢围挡的存在，彩钢围挡会将施工现场围成一个封闭的圆圈，安装彩钢围挡时有一定的要求，当安装彩钢围挡装置时，通常会建造混凝土浇筑的底层基础。	Small projects must also be equipped with color steel fence. As the color steel fence can separate the construction site from the outside, for safety reasons, this barrier is mainly located near the construction site. Therefore, we often see the existence of color steel fence near the construction site. The color steel fence will enclose the construction site into a closed circle. There are certain requirements when installing the color steel fence When the enclosure is installed, the bottom foundation of concrete pouring is usually constructed.

PE涂料对于材质有良好的附着性，彩涂钢板易于加工成型，价廉且产品多，颜色和光泽的选择余地大。聚酯涂料对耐紫外光性与涂膜耐粉化性，并不理想，因此PE涂料的使用仍需受到一些限制，一般用在空气污染不严重的地区或需多次成型加工的产品。	PE coating has good adhesion to materials, color coated steel plate is easy to process and shape, low price and many products, and there is a wide choice of color and luster. Polyester coating is not ideal for UV resistance and powdering resistance of film. Therefore, the use of PE coating still needs to be restricted. It is generally used in areas where air pollution is not serious or products that need to be molded for many times.
2、硅改性聚酯	2. Silicon modified polyester (SMP)
由于聚酯含有活性基-OH/-COOH，极易和其它高分子化和物反应，为改良PE的耐阳光性与粉化性，以色泽保持性与耐热性优的Silicone树脂作变性反应，和PE的变性比可于5%—50%之间，SMP提供钢板更好的持久性，其防蚀年限可长达10-12年，当然其价格也比较PE为高，但因Silicone树脂对材质的附着性和加工成型性并不理想，因此SMP彩涂钢板并不适用于需多次成型加工的场合，大部分用于建筑屋顶及外墙。	Because polyester contains active group - OH / - COOH, it is easy to react with other macromolecules and substances. In order to improve the sunlight resistance and powdering property of PE, silicone resin with excellent color retention and heat resistance is used for denaturation reaction, and the denaturation ratio of PE can be between 5% - 50%. SMP provides better durability of steel plate, and its anti-corrosion life can be as long as 10-12 years. Of course, its price is higher than that of PE The adhesion and processability of e resin to the material are not ideal. Therefore, SMP color coated steel sheet is not suitable for the occasions requiring multiple molding and processing, and most of them are used for building roofs and external walls.
3、高耐侯聚酯	3. High weather resistant polyester (HDP, high durable polymer)
抗震性	Earthquake resistance
低层别墅的屋面大都为坡屋面，因此屋面结构基本上采用的是由冷弯型彩钢钢构件做成的三角型屋架体系，轻钢构件在封完结构性板材及石膏板之后，形成了非常坚固的"板肋结构体系"，这种结构体系有着更强的抗震及抵抗水平荷载的能力，适用于抗震烈度为8度以上的地区。	Most of the roofs of low rise villas are sloping roofs. Therefore, the roof structure basically adopts the triangular roof truss system made of cold-formed color steel members. After sealing the structural plates and gypsum boards, the light steel components form a very solid "plate rib structure system". This structure system has stronger seismic resistance and horizontal load resistance, and is suitable for seismic intensity of 8 degrees On the district.
抗风性	Wind resistance
彩钢钢结构建筑重量轻、强度高、整体刚性好、变形能力强。建筑物自重仅是砖混结构的五分之一，可抵抗每秒70米的飓风，使生命财产能得到有效的保护。	The color steel structure building has the advantages of light weight, high strength, good overall rigidity and strong deformation ability. The self weight of the building is only one fifth of that of the brick concrete structure, which can resist the hurricane of 70 meters per second, so that life and property can be effectively protected.
耐久性	Durability
彩钢结构住宅结构全部采用冷弯薄壁钢构件体系组成，钢骨采用超级防腐高强冷轧镀锌板制造，有效避免彩钢板在施工和使用过程中的锈蚀的影响，增加了轻钢构件的使用寿命。结构寿命可达100年。	The color steel structure residential structure is composed of cold-formed thin-walled steel member system. The steel skeleton is made of super anti-corrosion high-strength cold-rolled galvanized sheet, which can effectively avoid the influence of corrosion of color steel plate in the process of construction and use, and increase the service life of light steel components. The service life of the structure can reach 100 years.
保温性	Thermal insulation
彩钢夹芯板采用的保温隔热材料以玻纤棉为主，具有良好的保温隔热效果。用以外墙的保温板，有效的避免墙体的“冷桥”现象，达到了更好的保温效果。100mm左右厚的R15保温棉热阻值可相当于1m厚的砖墙。	Glass fiber cotton is the main thermal insulation material used in color steel sandwich panel, which has good thermal insulation effect. The insulation board used for the external wall can effectively avoid the "cold bridge" phenomenon of the wall, and achieve better insulation effect. The thermal resistance of R15 insulation cotton with a thickness of about 100 mm can be equivalent to a brick wall with a thickness of 1 m.
隔音性	Sound insulation
隔音效果是评估住宅的一个重要指标，彩钢+轻钢体系安装的窗均采用中空玻璃，隔音效果好，隔音达40分贝以上；由轻钢龙骨、保温材料石膏板组成的墙体，其隔音效果可高达60分贝。	The sound insulation effect is an important index to evaluate the residential buildings. The windows installed in the color steel + light steel system adopt hollow glass, which has good sound insulation effect, and the sound insulation effect is more than 40 dB. The wall composed of light steel keel and thermal insulation material gypsum board can achieve the sound insulation effect as high as 60 dB.
健康性	Health
干作业施工，减少废弃物对环境造成的污染，彩钢材料可100%回收，其他配套材料也可大部分回收，符合当前环保意识；所有材料为绿色建材，满足生态环境要求，有利于健康。	Dry construction can reduce the environmental pollution caused by waste. Color steel materials can be recycled 100%, and most of other supporting materials can also be recycled, which conforms to the current environmental protection awareness. All materials are green building materials, which meet the requirements of ecological environment and are conducive to health.
舒适性	Comfort
彩钢墙体采用高效节能体系，具有呼吸功能，可调节室内空气干湿度；屋顶具有通风功能，可以使屋内部上空形成流动的空气间，保证屋顶内部的通风及散热需求。	The color steel wall adopts high-efficiency energy-saving system, which has breathing function and can adjust indoor air dry and humidity; the roof has ventilation function, which can form a flowing air room above the house to ensure the ventilation and heat dissipation requirements inside the roof.
快捷性	Speediness
全部干作业施工，不受环境季节影响。一栋300平方米左右的建筑，只需5个工人30个工作日可以完成从地基到装修的全过程。	All dry construction, not affected by environmental seasons. A 300 square meter building, only 5 workers, 30 working days can complete the whole process from foundation to decoration.
环保	environment protection
彩钢材料可100%回收，真正做到绿色无污染。	Color steel materials can be 100% recycled, truly green pollution-free.
节能	energy conservation
全部采用高效节能墙体，保温、隔热、隔音效果好，可达到50%的节能标准。	All adopt high efficiency energy-saving wall, heat insulation, sound insulation effect is good, can reach 50% energy-saving standard.
彩钢板活动房的一般寿命多少年？	How many years is the general life of color steel plate activity room?
彩钢板的使用寿命大约为20年。	The service life of color steel plate is about 20 years.
彩钢房是以彩钢复合板为墙体，以轻钢结构为骨架搭建而成。通常情况下，彩色镀锌钢板防腐层的保质期在10-15年，面漆在10-15年没有大的褪色，所以寿命在正常情况下可以超过10-15年。但是彩钢房的寿命也与环境、使用材料的质量和保养的方式有关。	The color steel house is built with color steel composite board as wall and light steel structure as framework. In general, the shelf life of the anticorrosive coating of color galvanized steel sheet is 10-15 years, and the top coat does not fade greatly in 10-15 years, so the service life can exceed 10-15 years under normal circumstances. But the life of color steel room is also related to the environment, the quality of materials used and the way of maintenance.
总的来说，彩钢板经久耐用，多种研究显示，经特殊涂层处理的夹芯彩钢板保质期在10-15年，以后每隔10年喷防腐涂料，板材的寿命可达35年以上。	In general, the color steel plate is durable. Many studies show that the shelf life of the sandwich color steel plate treated with special coating is 10-15 years. After spraying anti-corrosion coating every 10 years, the service life of the plate can reach more than 35 years.
在选择彩钢板时，需要选择质量性能优异的材料。由于夏天梅雨季节，彩钢板很容易受到雨水出现腐蚀情况，所以也要注意保养。1-2年刷涂保养油漆一次，这样既可以防止钢架生锈，又可以延长其使用寿命和保持美观。	In the selection of color steel plate, it is necessary to select the material with excellent quality and performance. Due to the plum rain season in summer, the color steel plate is easy to be corroded by rain, so attention should be paid to maintenance. Brush the maintenance paint once every 1-2 years, which can not only prevent the steel frame from rusting, but also prolong its service life and maintain its beauty.

钢结构施工工程资料怎么做？	How to do steel structure construction engineering data?
1、要切实作好钢结构制作及安装单位的考察与选择工作	1. It is necessary to do a good job in the investigation and selection of steel structure fabrication and installation units
我们知道，钢结构工程的施工要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，这两个阶段可由一个施工单位完成，但有时也可能由两个单位分别完成（分包）。	As we know, the construction of steel structure engineering should go through two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. These two stages can be completed by one construction unit, but sometimes it may be completed by two units separately (subcontracting).
切实作好钢结构制作单位和安装单位的考察与选择工作，对于确保钢结构工程质量及进度，具有重要意义。	It is of great significance for ensuring the quality and progress of steel structure engineering to do a good job in the investigation and selection of steel structure manufacturing and installation units.
钢结构制作、安装单位的考察内容主要有：企业资质，生产规模，技术人员数量、职称及履历，技术工人数量及资格证，机械设备情况，以及业绩情况等级。	The inspection contents of steel structure manufacturing and installation units mainly include: enterprise qualification, production scale, number of technical personnel, professional title and resume, number and qualification certificate of technical workers, mechanical equipment and performance level.
2、严格审查承包单位提交的钢结构制作工艺及安装施工组织设计	2. Strictly review the steel structure manufacturing process and installation construction organization design submitted by the contractor
施工组织设计是承包单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，认真审查施工组织设计是监理工作事前控制和主动控制的重要内容。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document prepared by the contractor to guide all activities in the whole process of project construction. Careful examination of construction organization design is an important content of pre control and active control of supervision work.
钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计，其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施，如关键零件的加工方法，主要构件的工艺流程、工艺措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	The manufacturing process and installation construction organization design shall be prepared for the steel structure engineering at the production stage and installation stage respectively. The manufacturing process content shall include the quality standards and technical requirements of each process and sub item in the production stage, as well as the specific measures formulated to ensure the product quality, such as the processing method of key parts, the process flow and process measures of main components Processing equipment, process equipment, etc.
3、要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作	3. Pay full attention to the supervision work in the production stage
如前所述，钢结构工程均要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，而制作和安装一般是由钢结构工程公司下属的两个基层单位（制作车间和安装项目部）分别负责，有时还可能由制造厂和安装公司两个单位分别完成（分包）。	As mentioned above, steel structure engineering must go through two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. Generally, the fabrication and installation are respectively undertaken by two grassroots units (production workshop and installation project department) of steel structure engineering company. Sometimes, it may be completed by two units (manufacturing plant and installation company) respectively (subcontracting).
监理工程师要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作，要象其他类型工程的监理工作一样，切实搞好事前控制和事中控制，对各工序、各分项都要做到检查认真而及时、严格而到位。	The supervision engineer should pay full attention to the supervision work in the production stage. Like the supervision work of other types of projects, the supervision engineer should do a good job of pre control and in-process control, and check each process and sub item seriously and timely, strictly and in place.
要避免那种放松工厂制作过程的监理，仅靠构件完成后进场验收的错误工作方法。这一点在制作单位距工程所在地路程较远的情况下，尤其要注意。	To avoid that kind of relaxation of the supervision of the factory manufacturing process, only rely on the component after the completion of the site acceptance of the wrong work method. This point should be paid special attention to when the manufacturing unit is far away from the project site.
4、安装阶段的监理	4. Supervision in installation stage
钢结构安装阶段的监理工作内容主要是监督承包单位内部管理体系和质保体系的运行情况，督促落实施工组织设计的各项技术、组织措施，严格按照国家现行钢结构有关规范、标准进行施工。	The supervision work content of steel structure installation stage is mainly to supervise the operation of the internal management system and quality assurance system of the contractor, to supervise the implementation of various technical and organizational measures of the construction organization design, and to carry out the construction in strict accordance with the relevant national specifications and standards for steel structures.
钢结构安装阶段的监理工作应重点抓好以下几个环节：安装方案的合理性和落实情况、安装测量、高强度螺栓的连接、安装焊接质量、安装尺寸偏差的实测、涂装等。	The supervision work of steel structure installation stage should focus on the following aspects: rationality and implementation of installation scheme, installation measurement, connection of high-strength bolts, installation welding quality, measurement of installation dimension deviation, coating, etc.
监理工作要加强现场巡视检查、平行检验和旁站监督，尤其是在目前部分钢结构施工单位素质偏低，施工仍欠规范的情况下，切实做好现场巡视和旁站，对于确保钢结构工程的施工质量，更有现实意义。	The supervision work should strengthen the on-site inspection, parallel inspection and on-site supervision, especially in the current situation that the quality of some steel structure construction units is low and the construction is still not standardized, it is of practical significance to do a good job of on-site inspection and on-site supervision to ensure the construction quality of steel structure engineering.
5、关于钢结构工程的试验检测工作	5. Test and inspection of steel structure engineering
钢结构工程的制作及安装施工的多项试验检测工作是一般土建工程所没有的，这些试验检测项目主要有：	A number of test and detection work for fabrication and installation of steel structure engineering are not available in general civil engineering. These test and detection items mainly include:
钢材原材有关项目的检测（必要时），	Inspection of relevant items of steel raw materials (if necessary),
焊接工艺评定试验（必要时），	Welding procedure qualification test (if necessary),
焊缝无损检测（超声波、X射线、磁粉等）、	Nondestructive testing of welds (ultrasonic, X-ray, magnetic powder, etc.)
高强度螺栓扭矩系数或预拉力试验、	Torque coefficient or pretension test of high strength bolts
高强度螺栓连接面抗滑移系数检测、	Test of anti slip coefficient of high strength bolt connection surface
钢网架节点承载力试验、	Bearing capacity test of steel grid joints
钢结构防火涂料性能试验等。	Performance test of fire retardant coating for steel structure.
彩涂钢板的表面状态可分为涂层板、压花板和印花板，彩涂钢板广泛用于建筑家电和交通运输等行业，对于建筑业主要用于钢结构厂房、机场、库房和冷冻等工业及商业建筑的屋顶墙面和门等，民用建筑采用彩钢板的较少。它与塑钢区别在于材料的构成不同．吸铁石可以吸动．严格意义上讲，塑钢与彩钢在金属特性及表面处理上并不能很好的区分，因为大同小异；现在市场的区分主要在型材结构方面。	The surface state of the color coated steel plate can be divided into coating plate, embossing plate and printing plate. The color coated steel plate is widely used in construction appliances, transportation and other industries. For the construction industry, it is mainly used for the roof walls and doors of industrial and commercial buildings such as steel structure factory buildings, airports, warehouses and refrigerators, and less color steel plate is used in civil buildings. The difference between it and plastic steel lies in the different composition of materials. The absorbers can be sucked. Strictly speaking, plastic steel and color steel can not be well distinguished in metal characteristics and surface treatment, because they are similar and slightly different; now the market is mainly divided in profile structure.
彩钢与塑钢区别在于材料的构成不同，彩涂钢板的基板为冷轧基板，热镀锌基板和电镀锌基板。涂层种类可分为聚酯、硅改性聚酯，偏聚二氟乙烯和塑料溶胶。彩涂钢板的表面状态可分为涂层板、压花板和印花板，彩涂钢板广泛用于建筑家电和交通运输等行业，对于建筑业主要用于钢结构厂房、机场、库房和冷冻等工业及商业建筑的屋顶墙面和门等，民用建筑采用彩钢板的较少。它与塑钢区别在于材料的构成不同．吸铁石可以吸动．严格意义上讲，塑钢与彩钢在金属特性及表面处理上并不能很好的区分，因为大同小异；现在市场的区分主要在型材结构方面。	The difference between color steel and plastic steel lies in the different composition of materials. The base plate of color coated steel plate is cold-rolled base plate, hot-dip galvanized base plate and electric galvanized base plate. Coating types can be divided into polyester, silicon modified polyester, vinylidene fluoride and plastisol. The surface state of the color coated steel plate can be divided into coating plate, embossing plate and printing plate. The color coated steel plate is widely used in construction appliances, transportation and other industries. For the construction industry, it is mainly used for the roof walls and doors of industrial and commercial buildings such as steel structure factory buildings, airports, warehouses and refrigerators, and less color steel plate is used in civil buildings. The difference between it and plastic steel lies in the different composition of materials. The absorbers can be sucked. Strictly speaking, plastic steel and color steel can not be well distinguished in metal characteristics and surface treatment, because they are similar and slightly different; now the market is mainly divided in profile structure.
彩钢琉璃瓦是通过彩钢成型设备将水平的彩色钢板压制而成。其中彩钢板可以分为很多种，但按大类来说，可以分为屋面板用材和墙面板用材。彩钢琉璃瓦一般做为屋面板材，铺设在用钢结构搭建的屋顶，这样即保证了建筑的美观，也可以延长建筑的使用寿命。	Color steel glazed tile is made by pressing horizontal color steel plate with color steel forming equipment. Among them, color steel plate can be divided into many kinds, but according to large categories, it can be divided into roof panel materials and wall panel materials. Colored steel glazed tile is generally used as roof plate, which is laid on the roof of steel structure, so as to ensure the beauty of the building and extend the service life of the building.
彩钢琉璃瓦的生产设备，全部是用铸铁和钢材制作的。底部是用H型钢做底坐，上面架起两面支撑架，分为很多排。每排中间留有一定的距离，用来放压型的轴。设计师根据板材的形状，设计出相应的轴。每个轴与轴之间用链条传动，在第一个轴之外，用减速机来带动。而减速机是用PLC系统全自动控制的。可以按需求来控制彩钢琉璃瓦板材的长短，得到理想的板材。	The production equipment of colored steel glazed tile is all made of cast iron and steel. H-shaped steel is used as the bottom seat at the bottom, and two supporting frames are set up on the top, which are divided into many rows. There is a certain distance in the middle of each row, which is used to release the pressure type shaft. According to the shape of the plate, the designer designs the corresponding axis. Each shaft is driven by a chain between the shafts. Besides the first shaft, it is driven by a reducer. The reducer is controlled by PLC system. We can control the length of colored steel glazed tile plate according to the demand, and get the ideal plate.
彩钢结构住宅结构全部采用冷弯薄壁钢构件体系组成，钢骨采用超级防腐高强冷轧镀锌板制造，有效避免彩钢板在施工和使用过程中的锈蚀的影响，增加了轻钢构件的使用寿命。结构寿命可达100年。彩钢夹芯板采用的保温隔热材料以玻纤棉为主，具有良好的保温隔热效果。用以外墙的保温板，有效的避免墙体的“冷桥”现象，达到了更好的保温效果。100mm左右厚的R15保温棉热阻值可相当于1m厚的砖墙。	The residential structure of color steel structure is composed of cold-formed thin-walled steel member system, and the steel bone is made of super anticorrosive high-strength cold-rolled galvanized steel plate, which effectively avoids the influence of corrosion of color steel plate in the process of construction and use, and increases the service life of light steel members. The structural life can be up to 100 years. The thermal insulation material used in the color steel sandwich panel is mainly glass fiber cotton, which has good thermal insulation effect. The insulation board used for the external wall can effectively avoid the phenomenon of "cold bridge" of the wall and achieve better insulation effect. The thermal resistance of R15 insulation cotton with the thickness of about 100mm can be equivalent to the brick wall with the thickness of 1m.
彩钢门窗的原材料是彩色镀锌钢板，所以彩钢门窗具有很高的强度和很好的耐腐蚀性能。彩钢门窗是用彩板为原材料制作而成的，有着极强的耐候性。彩钢门窗安装在建筑物上一般可与建筑物同等寿命。	The raw material of color steel doors and windows is color galvanized steel plate, so color steel doors and windows have high strength and good corrosion resistance. Color steel doors and windows are made of color plate as raw materials, with strong weather resistance. Color steel doors and windows installed on the building can generally have the same life as the building.
低层别墅的屋面大都为坡屋面，因此屋面结构基本上采用的是由冷弯型彩钢钢构件做成的三角型屋架体系，轻钢构件在封完结构性板材及石膏板之后，形成了非常坚固的"板肋结构体系"，这种结构体系有着更强的抗震及抵抗水平荷载的能力，适用于抗震烈度为8度以上的地区。	The roofs of low-rise villas are mostly sloped roofs, so the roof structure basically adopts a triangular roof truss system made of cold-formed color steel members.

Container sizes are various, but most of them have space sizes suitable for human settlements, and can be combined as needed. The appearance can also be used for various modeling designs, bright and beautiful.
彩钢板保温隔热	Color steel insulation
彩钢板复合板常用保温材料有：岩棉、玻璃纤维棉、聚苯乙烯（EPS）、聚氨酯等，导热系数低，从而活动房具有良好保温隔热效果。高强度彩钢板采用高强度钢板为基材（抗张拉强度5600kg/cm）再加上最先进的设计与滚压成型。因此彩钢板活动房具有极佳的结构特性。	The common thermal insulation materials of color steel plate composite board are rock wool, glass fiber cotton, polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane, etc., with low thermal conductivity, so the movable room has good thermal insulation effect. The high-strength color steel plate adopts high-strength steel plate as the base material (tensile strength 5600kg / cm), plus the most advanced design and roll forming. Therefore, the color steel movable house has excellent structural characteristics.
救灾活动板房的建设标准是抗震、保温、防火、隔热，其中每户20平方米左右，配备有液化气、供水、供电设施等，能基本满足灾民的生活需求。另外，还将根据居民的户数比例，进行学校、垃圾房、厕所等相关配套设施建设。这些活动板房可使用一到两年，能够解决灾民过渡期间的居住问题，解决了燃眉之急。	The construction standard of disaster relief panel house is earthquake resistance, thermal insulation, fire prevention and heat insulation. Each house is about 20 square meters, equipped with liquefied gas, water supply and power supply facilities, which can basically meet the needs of the victims. In addition, schools, garbage houses and toilets will be built according to the proportion of households. These movable panel houses can be used for one to two years, which can solve the living problems of the victims during the transitional period and solve the urgent problems.
钢结构是指用钢板和热扎、冷弯或焊接型材通过连接件连接而成的能承受和传递荷载的结构形式。钢结构体系具有自重轻、工厂化制造、安装快捷、施工周期短、抗震性能好、投资回收快、环境污染少等综合优势，与钢筋混凝土结构相比，更具有在“高、大、轻”三个方面发展的独特优势，在全球范围内，特别是发达国家和地区，钢结构在建筑工程领域中得到合理、广泛的应用。钢结构行业通常分为轻型钢结构、高层钢结构、住宅钢结构、空间钢结构和桥梁钢结构5大子类 。	Steel structure is a kind of structure which can bear and transmit load by connecting steel plate and hot-binding, cold-bending or welding profiles through connectors. Compared with reinforced concrete structure, steel structure system has the unique advantages of light weight, factory manufacturing, fast installation, short construction period, good seismic performance, fast investment recovery and less environmental pollution. Compared with reinforced concrete structure, it has the unique advantages of "high, large and light" development, especially in developed countries. In the region, steel structure has been reasonably and widely used in the field of construction engineering. Steel structure industry is usually divided into five sub-categories: light steel structure, high-rise steel structure, residential steel structure, space steel structure and bridge steel structure.

主要机组	Main units
上个世纪80年代末我国才陆续建设彩钢板机组，这些机组多建在钢铁厂及合资企业，彩钢板工艺设备基本从国外引进。到2000年国产彩钢板达到173万吨，出现了产能过剩。国有特大钢铁企业的机组产能、装备水平较高，都相继建成了采用国外技术、年生产能力12万～17万吨的彩钢板机组。	At the end of the 1980s, color steel plate mills were built one after another in China. Most of these mills were built in iron and steel plants and joint ventures. The color steel plate process equipment was basically imported from abroad. By 2000, the domestic color steel plate reached 1.73 million tons, resulting in overcapacity. The production capacity and equipment level of the units in the state-owned super-large iron and steel enterprises are relatively high. The color steel plate units with overseas technology and annual production capacity of 120,000-170,000 tons have been built successively.
同时，许多民营企业投资的彩钢板生产大多采用国产设备，产能较小，但上马快、投资低，产品主要面向建材、装饰行业。另外，外资、台资也纷纷登陆兴建彩涂机组，但大部分集中在沿海地区。1999年以来，随着彩涂板市场兴旺，彩涂板的生产及消费进入了快速增长期。从2000～2004年，生产量以平均39.0%的速度递增。到2005年止，全国彩涂板产能大于800万吨/年，还有一批彩涂机组正在建设之中，全国总产能超过900万吨/年。	At the same time, many private enterprises invest in color steel plate production mostly using domestic equipment, production capacity is small, but fast start, low investment, products mainly for building materials, decoration industry. In addition, foreign capital and Taiwanese capital have also landed to build color painting units, but most of them are concentrated in coastal areas. Since 1999, with the flourishing market of color coated panels, the production and consumption of color coated panels have entered a period of rapid growth. From 2000 to 2004, production increased at an average rate of 39.0%. By 2005, the national production capacity of color coated sheets was more than 8 million tons per year, and a number of color coated units were under construction, with a total production capacity of more than 9 million tons per year.
彩钢板的基板为冷轧基板，热镀锌基板和电镀锌基板。涂层种类可分为聚酯、硅改性聚酯、偏聚二氟乙烯和塑料溶胶。彩钢板的表面状态可分为涂层板、压花板和印花板，彩钢板广泛用于建筑家电和交通运输等行业，对于建筑业主要用于钢结构厂房、机场、库房和冷冻等工业及商业建筑的屋顶墙面和门等，民用建筑采用彩钢板的较少。	The base plate of color steel plate is cold rolled, hot galvanized and electrogalvanized. The types of coatings can be divided into polyester, silicon modified polyester, polyvinylidene fluoride and plastic sol. The surface state of color steel plate can be divided into coating plate, embossing plate and printing plate. Color steel plate is widely used in construction, household appliances, transportation and other industries. For the roof walls and doors of industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structure factory buildings, airports, warehouses and refrigeration, color steel plate is seldom used in civil buildings.

钢结构工程施工质量控制要点	Key points of construction quality control of steel structure engineering
随着现代经济的不断发展，钢结构工程以其施工速度快、周期短、强度高、便于预制、安装、适用高层大跨度等的优越性已在工程领域广泛应用。而过去，我国大量采用钢筋混凝土结构和预应力混凝土结构，现场工程技术人员比较缺乏钢结构工程的施工经验，施工质量的好坏直接影响工程结构的安全。因而，钢结构工程的质量问题也越来越引起人们的重视，因此加强钢结构工程施工质量控制，具有很重要的现实意义和必要性。	With the continuous development of modern economy, steel structure engineering has been widely used in engineering field for its advantages of fast construction, short period, high strength, easy to prefabricate, install, and apply high rise and large span. In the past, a large number of reinforced concrete structures and prestressed concrete structures were used in our country. The field engineering technicians lack the construction experience of steel structure engineering. The quality of construction directly affects the safety of the engineering structure. Therefore, the quality of the steel structure engineering has been paid more and more attention. Therefore, it is of great practical significance and necessity to strengthen the quality control of the construction of the steel structure.
施工质量控制要点	Key points of construction quality control

施工准备	Construction preparation
施工准备是建设施工创造必须条件，认真、细致、深入地做好施工准备工作，对充分发挥人的积极因素，合理组织人力、物力，加快工程进度，提供施工质量，节约投资和材料，对顺利完成钢结构建设任务起着重要的作用。	Construction preparation is a necessary condition for construction and construction. It is serious, meticulous and thorough to do a good job of construction preparation. It plays an important role in the successful completion of the construction of steel structure by giving full play to the positive factors of human beings, organizing the manpower and material resources reasonably, speeding up the project progress, providing the quality of construction, saving the investment and materials.
1.1认真做好施工图纸的会审和交底工作	1.1 Conferencing and submitting construction drawings
图纸是工程施工的依据，工程项目技术负责人应组织有关技术人员对图纸进行分工审阅和消化，其目的一是使施工单位和各参建单位熟悉设计图纸，了解工程特点和设计意图，找出需要解决的技术难题，并制定解决方案；二是为了解决图纸中存在的问题，减少图纸的差错，将图纸中的质量隐患消灭在萌芽之中。同时做好技术交底，做好施工和设计的结合、做好钢结构吊装与土建施工、钢结构和混凝土构预制的结合。	The drawings are the basis for the construction of the project. The technical officer of the engineering project should organize the technical personnel to examine and digest the drawings. The purpose of the drawings is to make the construction units and all the construction units familiar with the design drawings, to understand the engineering characteristics and the design intentions, to find out the technical problems to be solved and to formulate the solutions; two, In order to solve the problems in the drawings, reduce the errors in the drawings, eliminate the hidden dangers in the drawings. At the same time, we should make good technical disclosure, do well the combination of construction and design, do well in the combination of steel structure hoisting and civil construction, steel structure and precast concrete structure.
1.2认真编制钢结构工程施工组织设计	1.2 carefully compile the construction organization design of steel structure engineering
施工组织设计是施工单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，是一个科学的管理方法。施工单位在编制施工组织和施工方案时，须从人、机、料、法、环五个方面制定切实可行的具体实施细则，落实计划，落实组织人员，落实自检、互检和专检，把容易出现的质量问题全部纳入受控状态，确保方案技术措施得力、可行。在编制和贯彻施工组织设计过程中应做到广泛深入的研究，向施工人员交底，做到人人把关。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计。其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施。钢结构安装工程施工组织设计内容有质量保证体系和技术管理体系的建立、质量、进度控制的措施和方法、施工工期的安排等。	The construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document directed by the construction unit to guide the activities in the whole construction process, and is a scientific management method. In the preparation of construction organization and construction plan, the construction unit must formulate practical and concrete implementation rules from five aspects: human, machine, material, law and ring, implement the plan, implement the organization personnel, implement self inspection,guangduji.89ix.comsan.75ix.comguntongy.75ix.com www.shuzhids.75ix.com naizhen.75ix.comjianchajingj.75ix.cn mutual inspection and special inspection, and bring all the quality problems that are easy to be brought into the controlled state, and ensure that the technical and technical measures of the program are right. It is feasible. In the process of compiling and carrying out the construction organization design, extensive and thorough research should be done, and the bottom line should be laid down to the construction staff. For steel structure engineering, the manufacturing process and installation construction organization design should be worked out for the production stage and the installation stage respectively. The production process should include the working procedure of the production stage, the quality standard of each sub item, the technical requirement, and the specific measures to ensure the quality of the product. The construction organization and design of the steel structure installation project include the establishment of quality assurance system and technology management system, the measures and methods for quality and progress control, and the arrangement of construction period.

重视钢结构基础工程的质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of steel structure foundation engineering
钢结构基础工程的质量控制一般指钢结构基础预埋螺栓的质量控制，预埋螺栓是整个工程施工的第一步，也是非常关键的一步，是整个工程的基础。施工基础预埋螺栓时首先熟悉图纸，了解图纸的意图，应制作安装模板。预埋螺栓用两安装模板及钢筋定位在柱子的主筋和模板上，保证预埋螺栓不受土建浇注混凝土施工而移位。这样每组螺栓之间的间距、高低可控制在允许的误差范围内；同时，保护好螺栓丝扣，在混凝土浇筑时不被损坏。土建工程完工后，用经纬仪和水准仪对地脚螺栓的标高、轴线进行复查，并做好记录。并交下一道工序验收。	The quality control of the foundation engineering of steel structure generally refers to the quality control of the pre buried bolt of the steel structure. The pre buried bolt is the first step of the whole construction and a very critical step, and it is the foundation of the whole project. When the foundation bolts are embedded in the construction foundation, the drawings should be familiar with the intention of the drawings first, and the installation template should be made. The embedded bolts are positioned on the main reinforcement and the formwork of the column with two installation formwork and reinforcing bars to ensure that the embedded bolts are not moved by the construction of the pouring concrete. In this way, the spacing and height between the bolts of each group can be controlled within the allowable error range. At the same time, the bolt threads can not be damaged when the concrete is poured. After completion of the civil engineering, the elevation and axis of the anchor bolts should be reviewed with theodolite and level. And submit a procedure for acceptance.

钢结构制作工程质量控制	Quality control of steel construction engineering
钢结构工程的施工通常要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段。钢结构工程有大部分时间是在工厂车间内部进行，由于钢结构构件在工厂内加工制造的质量好坏，对钢结构工程的现场安装及整体结构的安全稳定至关重要。因此钢结构制作生产厂家必须具备相应企业资质、生产规模、技术能力、机械设备及先进的工艺水平。	The construction of steel structure usually has two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. The steel structure works most of the time in the factory workshop, because the quality of the steel structure components manufacturing in the factory is very important to the site installation and the safety and stability of the overall structure of the steel structure engineering. Therefore, manufacturers of steel structure must have corresponding qualification, production scale, technical capability, mechanical equipment and advanced technological level.
钢结构一般制作工艺流程分为:放样→下料→拼板→切割→组立→埋弧焊接→钻孔→组装→矫正成型→铆工零配件下料→制作组装→焊接和焊接检验→防锈处理、涂装、编号→构件验收出厂。在钢结构制作中，应根据钢结构制作工艺流程，抓住关键工序进行质量控制，如控制关键零件的加工，主要构件的工艺、措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	The general production process of steel structure is divided into three parts: layout, blanking, cutting board, cutting, assembling, submerged arc welding, drilling, assembling, correction forming, riveting and assembling, making and assembling, welding and welding inspection, rust prevention treatment, painting, numbering and acceptance of the factory. In the production of steel structure, the process flow should be made according to the steel structure, and the quality control is carried out by the key process, such as the processing of the key parts, the process and measures of the main components, the processing equipment and the process equipment.

重视焊接工程质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of welding engineering
在钢结构制作和安装工程工程中焊接工程是最重要的环节，必须重视焊接工程质量控制。目前，钢结构在生产过程中大部分采用具自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，个别部位采用手工施焊。	Welding engineering is the most important part in the fabrication and installation of steel structures, and the quality control of welding engineering must be emphasized. At present, most of the steel structures are equipped with automatic submerged arc welding machines, partly equipped with semi automatic gas shielded welding machines, and some parts are manually welded.
焊接质量问题较多存在于手工焊缝，这些问题有：焊瘤、夹渣、气孔、没焊透、咬边、错边、焊缝尺寸偏差大、不用引弧板、焊接变形不矫正、飞溅物清理不净等。鉴于这种情况，钢结构施焊前，对焊条的合格证要进行检查，按说明书要求使用，焊工必须持证上岗证，焊缝表面不得有裂纹	There are many problems of welding quality in hand weld, such as welding, slag, gas hole, no penetration, bite, wrong side, large deviation of weld size, no arc plate, no correction of welding deformation and clean spatter. In view of this situation, before the steel structure is welded, the qualification certificate for the welding rod should be checked, and the welder must be certificated with the certificate, and there shall be no cracks on the surface of the weld.
单层厂房钢结构的组成	Composition of steel structure of single storey factory building
厂房结构的组成	The composition of the structure of the factory building
单层厂房钢结构一般是由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架、柱、吊车梁、制动梁（或桁架）、各种支撑以及墙架等构件组成的空间刚性骨架	Steel structure workshop is generally composed of purlin, roof rack, roof, bracket, column, crane beam, brake beam (or truss), space rigid frame and various supporting wall frame components
这些构件按其作用，可归并成下列体系：	These components can be incorporated into the following systems according to their functions:
(1) 横向平面框架——是厂房的基本承重结构，由柱和横梁（屋架）组成。承受作用在厂房的横向水平荷载和竖向荷载并传递到基础。	(1) the horizontal plane frame, the basic load-bearing structure of the plant, is composed of columns and beams (roof frames). The lateral horizontal load and vertical load of the plant are transmitted to the foundation.
(2) 纵向平面框架——由柱、托架、吊车梁及柱间支撑等构成。其作用是保证厂房骨架的纵向不可变形和刚度，承受纵向水平荷载（吊车的纵向制动力、纵向风力等）并传递到基础。	(2) longitudinal plane frame is composed of columns, brackets, columns between crane beam support. Its function is to ensure the vertical deformation and stiffness of the workshop skeleton, and to bear the longitudinal horizontal load (the longitudinal braking force and longitudinal wind force) of the crane, and transmit it to the foundation.
(3) 屋盖系统——由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架及屋盖支撑等构成。	(3) - roof system composed of purlin, roof rack, roof and roof support bracket, etc..
(4) 吊车梁及制动梁——主要承受吊车的竖向荷载和水平荷载，并传递到横向框架和纵向框架。	(4) the crane beam and the brake beam, which mainly bear the vertical load and horizontal load of the crane, are transferred to the transverse frame and the longitudinal frame.
(5) 支撑——包括屋盖支撑、柱间支撑及其它附加支撑。其作用是将单独的平面框架连成空间体系，以保证结构具有必要的刚度和稳定性，同时也有承受风力及吊车制动力的作用。	(5) support, including roof support, inter column support and other additional support. Its function is to connect a separate plane frame into a space system, so as to ensure that the structure has the necessary stiffness and stability, and also has the function of bearing the power of wind and crane.
(6) 墙架——承受墙体的重量和风力。	(6) a wall frame - bearing the weight of the wall and the wind.
此外，还有一些次要的构件如工作平台、梯子、门窗等。	In addition, there are some minor components, such as work platforms, ladders, doors and windows, etc.
各种构件的用钢量占整个厂房钢结构的总用钢量的比值大致如表所示。	The ratio of steel amount to the total amount of steel used for the entire steel structure of the whole plant is roughly as shown in the table.
厂房按单位面积计算的用钢量，是评定设计的经济合理性的一项重要指标。各类厂房单位面积用钢量的统计数值见下表	The amount of steel used in the workshop by unit area is an important index for evaluating the economic rationality of the design. The statistical value of the amount of steel used in the unit area of all kinds of workshops is shown in the following table
柱的类型	Type of column
柱按结构形式可分为：等截面柱和阶形柱。	The column can be divided into the same section column and the order column according to the structure form.
柱按柱的截面形式分为：实腹式柱和格构式柱。	The column is divided into the concrete column and the lattice column according to the cross section of the column.
柱脚按结构内力的边界条件划分，可分为铰接柱脚和刚性固定柱脚两大类。铰接柱脚仅传递竖向荷载和水平荷载，刚性固定柱脚除传递竖向和水平荷载外，还传递弯矩。刚性固定柱脚就其构造形式可分为三种形式：露出式柱脚、埋入式或插入式柱脚、外包式柱脚。按柱脚的结构形式则可分为整体式柱脚和分离式柱脚。	The column divided by boundary conditions of the internal force of the structure, can be divided into rigid fixed hinged column andwww.jilinyanglao.com.cnwww.jilinbanjia.com.cn www.diandongmenj.net.cn www.siliemoji.cnwww.chanraomoji.com.cnwww.lashenmoji.cn column two categories. The hinged column transfer only vertical load and horizontal load, rigid fixed base in addition to transfer of vertical and horizontal loads, but also transfer moment. The structural form of rigid fixed base can be divided into three forms: a type of embedded column, or insert column, column foot. According to the structure of the form of the column can be divided into integral column and separated column.
钢柱的安装方法一般采用三种方法，即采用钢垫板方案、座浆垫板方案和调平螺帽与调平钢板方案。	Three methods are generally used for the installation of steel columns, that is, the steel cushion plate, the slurry cushion and the flat plate and the leveling steel plate.
构件工地拼装	Component site assembly
构件拼装是将若干个分段构件或单件，按设计要求在地面装配成完整的构件或构件组合体。	Component assembly is to assemble a number of piecewise components or single pieces to be assembled into complete components or component combinations on the ground according to the design requirements.
(1) 单一构件拼装	(1) single component assembly
1). 钢柱拼装	1). Steel column assembly
大型钢柱一般在变截面处或肩梁上部分段，进行分段运输。工地拼装后，用焊接或高强度螺栓连接，组成整根柱子进行吊装。	Large steel columns are generally segmented at the variable section or on the upper part of the shoulder beam for subsection transportation. After the construction site is assembled, the whole root column is hoisted with welded or high strength bolts.
首先在一条轴线上设置拼装台架，将钢柱下段吊放到台架上，垫平并确定中心线，再将柱的上段吊放到连接处，使两节柱插接端对准，拼接到位，仔细校准柱的中心轴线和长度尺寸等后，即可按图纸要求进行焊接或高强度螺栓连接固定。	First set the assembling bench at an axis on the steel column under section dipping to bench pad and determine the center line, then the upper column dipping into joints, the two column inserted end alignment, stitching in place, carefully calibrated column size and the length of the central axis, can according to the requirements of the drawings welding or high strength bolt connection fixation.
2). 钢屋架及天窗架拼装	2). Assembly of steel roof truss and skylight frame
一般采用平拼法，即将分块构件平卧于拼装平台上拼装。在起重机性能允许的条件下还可以将天窗架与屋架构件拼装成一体。拼装钢桁架时，要严格控制跨度误差和扭曲，使其不超出允许值。在翻转桁架时，为了防止变形，应确定合理的吊点，必要时还要进行临时加固。	Generally, the flat method is used, which is about to lie on the assembly platform. In the crane performance under permissible conditions can also be integrated with the roof member day window frame assembly. When the steel truss is assembled, the span error and distortion should be strictly controlled so that it does not exceed the allowable value. In order to prevent the deformation of the truss, a reasonable lifting point should be determined and temporary reinforcement should be carried out when necessary.
对于有天窗的大跨度屋架或高度较大的桁架，应用立拼法拼装，因为这种桁架的翻转是非常困难的。	For a large span roof truss with a skylight or a high height truss, a spelling spelling is applied, because the flipping of this truss is very difficult.
(1) 构件组合拼装	(1) component assembly and assembly
当具备大型起重机械，且按照条件允许时，可将诸多构件在地面拼装成一个稳定单元块体，进行整体吊装。这样可减少高空作业，有利于安全施工和提高工作效率，保证构件吊装的稳定性。例如两榀屋架与斜撑组合拼装、斜桥构架及通廊桁架组合拼装等。	When a large lifting machine is available and the conditions permit, a number of components can be assembled into a stable unit block on the ground to be hoisted as a whole. In this way, the operation of high altitude can be reduced, the safety construction and the efficiency of work can be improved, and the stability of the hoisting of the components is ensured. For example, two pieces of roof and brace assembly, bridge frame and truss corridor assembly etc..
构件组合拼装在安装现场进行，拼装位置必须在安装起重机的作用范围内。拼装的项目和规模必须根据起重机的性能、构件的强度、刚度、稳定性及施工环境等因素确定。	The component assembly is assembled at the installation site, and the assembly position must be within the scope of the installation of the crane. The project and scale of the assembly must be determined according to the performance of the crane, the strength of the component, the stiffness, the stability and the construction environment.

如何避开彩钢屋顶漏水？	How to avoid the leakage of the color steel roof?
目前彩钢金属板被广泛应用于家庭自搭结构顶板，如自封飘窗顶、自搭房屋面。	At present, the color steel plate is widely used in the family roof structure, such as self sealing ceiling and self building.
在北方与彩钢板搭接的房屋原有立墙结构往往存在保温构造层，而后搭设的金属板材与墙体多数只是对接，未对结构墙面进行任何开槽固定等处理，在后期使用中因受风雨侵蚀、温度变化及使用年限影响，搭接部位密封不严实等很容易造成渗漏问题。	The structure of the original vertical wall structure of the building in the north and the colored steel plate often exists the thermal insulation layer, and the metal plate and the wall are only butted, and the structure wall is not fixed. In the later use, the lap parts are sealed because of the influence of the wind and rain erosion, the temperature change and the service life. It is easy to cause leakage.
涂刷沥青维修	Repair of bitumen
为避免渗漏问题发生或者渗漏后进行维修治理的方法各有不同，各出奇招，打发泡胶密封、涂刷沥青材料、卷材覆盖等等，但其防水治理效果也不尽相同，有些方法可能只是解一时之需，无法达到长期治理、补漏的效果。	In order to avoid leakage or leakage, the methods of maintenance and treatment are different. They are different, they send out the bubble gum seal, the bitumen material, the roll cover and so on. But the effect of waterproof treatment is not the same, some methods may only solve the temporary needs, and can not reach the effect of long-term treatment and leakage.
卷材覆盖维修	Cover maintenance
由于搭设的彩钢板多为彩钢夹芯板，即两层成型金属面板和中间发泡、熟化成型的泡沫、岩棉或其他隔热内芯组成。为有效密封搭接缝并防止雨水从板材缝隙向下部保温层串水，需对渗漏的彩钢板整体进行防水防护处理。	The color steel plate is mostly made of color steel sandwich panels, which is composed of two layers forming metal www.gangsiguan.com.cnwww.zidongmeni.cnwww.jinanbanjia.net.cnwww.jinanyanglao.cn www.qingdaobanjia.net.cnwww.zidongmeni.com.cnpanels and intermediate foams, cured foams, rock wool or other heat insulation inner cores. In order to effectively seal the joints and prevent rainwater from the seam to the lower insulation layer, it is necessary to protect the leaked color steel sheet as a whole.

集装箱活动房安装的误区	Misconceptions in installation of container movable rooms
大家在安装集装箱活动房的时候，一定要注意这几大误区：	When installing container activities rooms, we must pay attention to these misunderstandings.
误区1：彩钢房檩条设计尺寸与安装尺寸实际不符，对于集装箱房安装过程中与设计方案尺寸不符，平时不要小看这个安装细节，安装不好轻则对屋面板变型，重则对房屋倒塌，	Mistake 1: Color steel house purlins design size and installation size does not conform to the actual, for the container room installation process and design plan size does not conform to the usual installation details, do not underestimate this installation, installation is not good light on the roof deck deformation, heavy on the collapse of the house.
改正1：当钢架安装完毕后，确保万一，从檩条边到中准确测量实际尺寸，将彩钢板尺寸加工好既就安装。	Correction 1: When the steel frame is installed, make sure that in case the actual size is accurately measured from purlin side to middle, the color steel plate size is machined and installed.
误区2：盲目的用材	Myth 2: blind timber
工程进场，起初基础刚刚做好，就大量的将材料运进工地，易造成安装不便、材料多少也会沾上泥巴，造成起初预备的材料进场方案。	As soon as the foundation is finished, a large number of materials will be transported to the site, which will easily cause inconvenience in installation and mud on the amount of materials, resulting in the initial preparation of the material admission scheme.
改正2：用材要按照流程：1.锚栓进场，2.钢柱、济宁彩钢房钢梁及钢构配件进场，3.彩钢进场，4.门窗进场及防水材料。按照以上几点流程有可效的保护安装不便、沾泥巴等。	Correction 2: Material to follow the process: 1. Anchor bolt into the field, 2. Steel columns, Jining color steel house steel beams and steel components into the field, 3. color steel into the field, 4. doors and windows into the field and waterproof materials. According to the above process, effective protection, installation inconvenience, mud and so on.
误区3：私自更改彩钢房设计方案	Misunderstanding 3: privately change the design scheme of color steel housing
通常安装工人为了节省工期，往往不按设计方案安装，私自更改彩钢房设计方案，将设计方案简单化。	Usually, in order to save time, installation workers often do not install according to the design scheme, alter the design scheme of the color steel house privately, and simplify the design scheme.
改正3：乙方在与安装工人安装前必须对安装工人讲明设计方案的重要性，以免工人偷工减料，使结构稳定性不受保障。	Correction 3: Party B must explain the importance of the design scheme to the installation workers before installing with the installation workers, so as to avoid jerry-building and material reduction, so that the structural stability is not guaranteed.
钢结构工程的施工	Construction of steel structure engineering
1、要切实作好钢结构制作及安装单位的考察与选择工作	1. The investigation and selection of the production and installation units of the steel structure should be conscientiously done.
我们知道，钢结构工程的施工要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，这两个阶段可由一个施工单位完成，但有时也可能由两个单位分别完成（分包）。切实作好钢结构制作单位和安装单位的考察与选择工作，对于确保钢结构工程质量及进度，具有重要意义。钢结构制作、安装单位的考察内容主要有：企业资质，生产规模，技术人员数量、职称及履历，技术工人数量及资格证，机械设备情况，以及业绩情况等级。点这免费下载施工技术资料	As we know, the construction of steel structure has to go through two stages: Factory fabrication and on-site installation. These two stages can be completed by a construction unit, but sometimes it can be completed by two units separately. It is of great significance to ensure the quality and progress of the steel structure engineering by making a good work on the inspection and selection of the production units and installation units of steel structures. The research contents of the production and installation of steel structure mainly include: enterprise qualification, production scale, number of technical personnel, professional title and resume, number of technical workers, qualification certificates, machinery and equipment, and performance level.

2、严格审查承包单位提交的钢结构制作工艺及安装施工组织设计	2. Strictly examine the design of the steel construction technology and the installation and construction organization submitted by the contractor
施工组织设计是承包单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，认真审查施工组织设计是监理工作事前控制和主动控制的重要内容。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计，其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施，如关键零件的加工方法，主要构件的工艺流程、工艺措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document guiding the Contractor's activities in the whole construction process. The careful review of construction organization design is an important part of pre control and active control in supervision work. Steel structure engineering for production and installation stage respectively in the preparation of construction organization design and installation of production process, the production process includes the production stage of each process and each sub quality standards, technical requirements, and to ensure the quality of products and to develop the specific measures, such as the key parts of the processing method, technological process, main component the process measures, processing equipment, the process equipment etc..
3、要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作	3, we should pay full attention to the supervision work in the production stage
如前所述，钢结构工程均要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，而制作和安装一般是由钢结构工程公司下属的两个基层单位（制作车间和安装项目部）分别负责，有时还可能由制造厂和安装公司两个单位分别完成（分包）。监理工程师要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作，要象其他类型工程的监理工作一样，切实搞好事前控制和事中控制，对各工序、各分项都要做到检查认真而及时、严格而到位。要避免那种放松工厂制作过程的监理，仅靠构件完成后进场验收的错误工作方法。这一点在制作单位距工程所在地路程较远的情况下，尤其要注意。	As mentioned earlier, the steel structure engineering must pass through factory production and installation of two stages, and the production and installation is two units under the steel structure engineering company (production workshop and installation project department) are responsible for, and sometimes were completed by the factory and the company installed two units (including package). The supervision engineer should pay enough attention to the supervision work in the production stage, like the supervision work of other types of projects, do well the control before and in the middle affairs, and check every process and sub item strictly, timely and strictly. It is necessary to avoid the supervision of the process of relaxing factory production, and the wrong method of working for the post acceptance check only by the component. This point should be paid attention to in the case that the production unit is far away from the site of the project.
4、安装阶段的监理	4, the supervision of the installation stage
钢结构安装阶段的监理工作内容主要是监督承包单位内部管理体系和质保体系的运行情况，督促落实施工组织设计的各项技术、组织措施，严格按照国家现行钢结构有关规范、标准进行施工。钢结构安装阶段的监理工作应重点抓好以下几个环节：安装方案的合理性和落实情况、安装测量、高强度螺栓的连接、安装焊接质量、安装尺寸偏差的实测、涂装等。监理工作要加强现场巡视检查、平行检验和旁站监督，尤其是在目前部分钢结构施工单位素质偏低，施工仍欠规范的情况下，切实做好现场巡视和旁站，对于确保钢结构工程的施工质量，更有现实意义。	The supervision work of steel structure installation stage is the main operation of the supervision contractor internal management system and quality assurance system, supervise the implementation of the technology, organization design measures of construction, the construction in strict accordance with the current national norms and standards of steel structure. During the installation phase of steel structure, we should focus on the following aspects: the rationality and implementation of installation plan, installation and measurement, connection of high-strength bolts, installation and welding quality, installation size deviation measurement and painting. To strengthen the supervision of site inspection, site of parallel inspection and supervision, especially in the current unit part of steel structure construction quality is low, the construction is still owed norms, to do on-site inspection and supervision, to ensure the construction quality of steel structure engineering, more practical significance.
5、关于钢结构工程的试验检测工作	5. On testing and testing of steel structure engineering
钢结构工程的制作及安装施工的多项试验检测工作是一般土建工程所没有的，这些试验检测项目主要有：钢材原材有关项目的检测（必要时），焊接工艺评定试验（必要时），焊缝无损检测（超声波、X射线、磁粉等）、高强度螺栓扭矩系数或预拉力试验、高强度螺栓连接面抗滑移系数检测、钢网架节点承载力试验、钢结构防火涂料性能试验等。	Production and installation of the number of test work of steel structure engineering is the general civil engineering does not, these test items include: detection of steel raw material of the project (if necessary), welding procedure qualification test (if necessary), non destructive testing of weld (super sonic, X ray, magnetic powder, etc.) the strength of bolt torque coefficient or pre tension test, high strength bolt connection surface detection, anti slip coefficient of steel truss joint bearing capacity test and performance test of steel structure fire retardant coating.
作好这些试验、检测工作要注意以下几点：	The following points should be paid attention to in doing these tests and testing.
（1）要监督委托有相应资质的检测机构进行；	(1) to supervise the inspection agencies entrusted with corresponding qualifications;
（2）要坚持取样、送检的见证制度，要避免试件与工程不一致现象；	(2) we should adhere to the witness system of sampling and inspection, and avoid the inconsistency between the test pieces and the project.
（3）对于部分检测项目，具有相应资质的检测机构较少，路程较远，且费用较高，在这种情况下，监理工程师必须坚持原则，态度明确，立场坚定，及时督促承包单位落实这些工作，这是确保钢结构制作与安装质量及施工进度的必要措施，也是国家现行钢结构工程施工质量验收规范规定的“主控项目”。	(3) for some test items, with the corresponding qualification testing organization is less, the distance, and the cost is higher, in this case, the engineer must adhere to the principle of a clear attitude, stand firm, to urge the contractor to implement these work, it is necessary to ensure the measures of steel structure fabrication and installation quality and construction schedule the main control program, the current national regulations and steel structure construction quality acceptance "".
6、钢结构工程其它几个重要质量控制点	6. Some other important quality control points for steel structure engineering
6.1 地脚螺栓的预埋	The preembedding of 6.1 anchor bolts
地脚螺栓的预埋质量直接影响钢结构的安装质量，控制好地脚螺栓（群）的位置、垂直度、长度和标高，对于减少扩孔及调整工作量（甚至避免返工），提高结构安装质量具有重要意义。地脚螺栓的预埋方法可采用直接预埋法，也可采用预留孔法。基础砼浇筑前监理工程师必须严格检查预埋螺栓施工方法的合理性、可靠性，以及各项实测指标是否在规范规定范围内。点这免费下载施工技术资料	The embedment quality of anchor bolts directly affects the installation quality of steel structures. Controlling the location, perpendicularity, length and elevation of anchor bolts is of great significance for reducing reaming and adjusting workload, or even avoiding rework, and improving the quality of structure installation. The pre embedding method of the anchor bolts can be used directly, and the reserved hole method can be used. Before the foundation concrete is poured, the supervision engineer must strictly check the rationality and reliability of the construction method of the embedded bolts, and whether the measured indicators are within the prescribed limits.

6.2 焊接工程质量控制	6.2 quality control of welding engineering
焊接工程是钢结构制作和安装工程最重要的分项之一，监理工程师必须从事前准备，施焊过程和成品检验各个环节，切实作好焊接工程的质量控制工作。目前，我市钢结构施工单位绝大部分都具备自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，仅在个	Welding engineering is one of the most important sub items in the fabrication and installation works of steel structure. The supervision engineer must engage in the preparation, welding process and inspection of finished products, and do well the quality control work of welding engineering. At present, most of the construction units of steel structure in our city have automatic submerged arc welding machines, some of which have semi-automatic gas protection welding machines.
钢结构制作质量未达到要求的表现	The quality of steel structure is not up to the required performance.
1切割、下料	1 cutting and blanking
在切割、下料时，翼缘板尺寸宽窄不一，造成H型钢与牛腿的尺寸不一致，与牛腿联系的钢梁上下翼缘板错位约一个板厚；切割边缘有较深的切痕，板边有明显的凹陷，或有较深的锯齿印，切割粗糙度超标，拼板边缘切割不垂直度，拼接错边等超标。	When cutting and cutting, the width of flange plate is different, resulting in the size of H-beam and corbel is not consistent, and the upper and lower flange plate of the steel beam connected with corbel is about one plate thickness; the cutting edge has deep notch, the edge of the plate has obvious depression, or has deep serrated impression, the cutting roughness exceeds the standard, the edge of the jigsaw cutting is not vertical. Exceed the standard.
2组装	2 assembly
在组装时，焊接H钢无组装胎架，造成H型钢高度尺寸有偏差，腹板偏中心；翼腹板对接后，焊缝未矫平，有明显凹凸；轻钢腹板不平整，组装前未矫正。	When assembling, welded H-steel has no assembled frame, resulting in H-steel height deviation, web deviation center; wing web butt, weld seam is not rectified, there is obvious concavity and convexity; light steel web is not uniform, not rectified before assembling.
3焊接	3 welding
在焊接方面，轻钢焊接H型钢翼板开料后再拼接，焊缝未安装引熄弧板，造成焊缝不饱满，边缘有凹坑未熔合等，与母材不齐平；柱脚、牛腿的焊脚尺寸小于设计图纸的规定，角焊缝塌边现象严重，收弧处普遍低于母材，气孔较多；使用CO2焊的焊缝成形差，宽窄不一致，高低不一致，忽大忽小；手工焊焊缝不直，宽窄不一，咬边现象严重；焊渣飞溅未清除干净。	In welding, the light steel welded H-beam wing plate spliced after cutting material, welded seam did not install arc ignition and extinguishing plate, resulting in insufficient weld, edge pits did not fuse, and the base metal is not even; column foot, bracket foot size is smaller than the design drawings, fillet weld collapsing phenomenon is serious, arc closure is generally lower than the base metal, gas hole is relatively. Many; The weld with CO2 welding is poor in shape, width is not consistent, height is not consistent, big or small; manual welding seam is not straight, width is not the same, the phenomenon of undercutting is serious; welding slag spatter is not clean.
4钻孔	4 drill hole
在钻孔方面，事前未很好会审图纸，在该开单排孔的地方，开了双排孔，结果未补孔就留存在构件上。如柱与牛腿连接处的H型钢为双排孔，而大梁与次梁相同规格的H型钢为单排孔，但开孔时都开了双排孔，安装后影响了强度和外观质量。	As for drilling, the drawings were not well read beforehand, and double rows of holes were opened in the place where the single row of holes were opened. As a result, the holes remained on the components without filling. For example, H-section steel at the joint of column and corbel is double-row hole, while H-section steel of the same specification of main beam and secondary beam is single-row hole, but double-row hole is opened when opening, which affects the strength and appearance quality after installation.
5总装过程	5 assembly process
总装过程中，钢柱牛腿与H型钢梁连接处上下错位，左右错位，未控制好尺寸。	During the assembly process, the top and bottom of the steel column corbel and H-beam are dislocated, left and right are dislocated, and the size is not well controlled.
6除锈与油漆	6 rust removal and paint
除锈与油漆方面：除锈马虎，未达到等级要求，油漆不久就出现返锈、剥落；漆膜厚度不均匀，阳面厚度普遍超厚，可达250μm，但阴面往往在90μm左右（室内漆膜厚度规定为125μm）；油漆前杂质未清除干净，污物多，高低不平，流挂现象较普遍。	Rust removal and paint: rust removal sloppy, did not meet the grade requirements, the paint soon appeared rust back, peeling; paint film thickness is uneven, the thickness of the positive surface is generally super thick, up to 250 microns, but the shade is often around 90 microns (indoor film thickness is set at 125 microns); impurities before the paint is not clean, dirt, uneven, uneven. Flow hanging is more common.
7构件运输存放	7 component transportation storage
在构件运输和堆放过程中，无搁置件垫平堆放，而是随意卸车，杂乱堆放，甚至让构件埋入泥堆水沟中，造成构件变形、碰伤和污染。	In the process of transportation and stacking of components, there is no shelving pad stacking, but random unloading, random stacking, and even let the components buried in the mud pile ditch, resulting in deformation, damage and pollution of components.
8构件出厂	8 component factory
构件出厂时，钢柱、钢梁的中心线标记未标示，相当普遍，给安装施工矫正检测带来困难。	When the components leave the factory, the mark of the center line of the steel column and the steel beam is not marked, which is quite common and brings difficulties to the installation, construction and rectification inspection.
9翼腹板拼接	9 wing web splicing
翼腹板拼接长度不符合要求。如翼板拼接长度不应小于翼板宽度的2倍，翼缘板与腹板拼接焊缝应错开200mm以上，腹板拼接长度不小于600mm。但实际往往未达到上述要求。	The stitching length of web web does not meet the requirements. If the length of flange splicing should not be less than twice the width of flange, flange and web splicing weld should be staggered more than 200 mm, web splicing length should not be less than 600 mm. But the reality often fails to meet the above requirements.
工业厂房、仓库	Industrial buildings and warehouses
彩钢夹芯板主要应用于工业厂房、仓库的屋面和外墙。过去的工业厂房屋面多采用预制混凝土板或石棉板。随着轻钢结构的迅速推广，夹芯板也以其多项显著的优势取代了上述2种材料。	Color steel sandwich panels are mainly used in industrial buildings, roofs and external walls of warehouses. In the past, prefabricated concrete boards or asbestos boards were used in the roofs of industrial buildings. With the rapid expansion of the light steel structure, the 2 kinds of materials have been replaced by the sandwich panels with a number of significant advantages.
在提供更好隔热效果的同时，夹芯板配合已成熟发展的轻钢结构，能够真正体现轻钢体系轻质、快速高效、布置灵活等一系列优势，因而在目前的单层厂房建筑中已成为首选的方案。	While providing better insulation effect, sandwich panels, combined with the developed lightweight steel structure, can truly represent a series of advantages such as lightweight, fast and efficient layout and flexible layout of light steel system, so it has become the first choice in the current single story factory building.
而对于多层工业厂房，除了顶屋的屋面可采用夹芯板外，外墙也可利用夹芯板作灵活的布置，通过彩涂板多变的色彩和形状达到美化建筑外观的目的。对于恒温恒湿要求的工业建筑，采用热工性能优于砖墙的夹芯板作为围护材料，可大大节约建成后的运营成本。	For multi-storey industrial buildings, besides the roof, the roof can be made of sandwich panels. The outer wall can also be flexibly arranged by sandwich panels, and the purpose of beautifying the architectural appearance can be achieved by changing the color and shape of the color coated boards. For the industrial buildings with constant temperature and humidity requirements, the sandwich panels with the thermal performance superior to the brick wall are used as enclosure materials, which can greatly save the operation cost after the completion of the construction.
公共建筑	Public buildings
彩钢夹芯板主要可应用于有大空间需要的公共建筑的屋面和外墙中，如：机制、车站的候机或候车大厅，体育场馆、影剧院和礼堂、展览馆和会展中心、博物馆，等等。	The color steel sandwich panels can be mainly applied to the roofs and exterior walls of public buildings with large space requirements, such as mechanism, station waiting or waiting hall, stadiums, theaters and auditorium, exhibition centers and exhibition centers, museums and so on.
公共建筑由于具有需提供更大的空间、有室内空调、防火等一系列比工业厂房更高要求的特点，目前此类建筑多采用网架或管桁架的屋架结构形式，因此对屋面板的材料在轻质、保温和隔热、防火安全、防水、吸声、耐久性等方面都提出了更高的要求。	Because of the public buildings need to provide more space, indoor air conditioning, fire and a series of industrial buildings than the higher requirements of the characteristics of roof structure the building adopts the grid or pipe truss, the roofing material in light weight, heat preservation and heat insulation, fire prevention, waterproof, sound absorption, durability and safety other aspects are put forward higher requirements.
广泛运用到我们的生活中，主要原因还是在于彩涂板具有良好的防腐蚀性能，而且易于加工改造，比其他材质的板材都要轻，所以彩涂板才会在建筑市场上受到极大的重视。那么，彩涂板是什么以及彩涂板市场用途是什么呢?我们一起来看看吧。	Widely used in our life, the main reason is that the color coating plate has good corrosion resistance, and easy to process and transform, lighter than the other materials, so color coating plate will be paid great attention to in the building market. Then, what is the color coated board and the market application of the color coated plate? Let's have a look.
彩涂板市场用途	Market use of color coating board
彩涂板是一种新型的复合材料，有PCM和VCM两种。什么是复合材料呢?想必很多人多它都存在着疑问，复合材料就是由有机高分子、无机非金属或金属等几类不同材料通过复合工艺组合而成的新型材料。	Color coated sheet is a new type of composite material, which has two kinds of PCM and VCM. What is composite material? It is necessary for many people to doubt that the composite material is a new type of material composed of a combination of organic polymer, inorganic nonmetal or metal and other different materials.
彩涂板适用于多的领域，包括建筑、家电和交通运输三部分。在建筑领域，因为彩涂板涂层钢板具有轻质、美观和防腐蚀性能，所以它被广泛用于建造钢结构厂房、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶和墙面。在家电领域，彩涂板用于生产冰箱、微波炉等家电的表面。在交通运输方面，彩涂板被应用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等方面的生产，加工。	Color coated panels are applied to many fields, including building, household appliances and transportation three parts. In the field of architecture, color coated plate coated steel plates are lightweight, beautiful and anticorrosive, so it is widely used to build roofs and walls of industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, storeroom, freezers, and so on. In the field of household appliances, color coated boards are used to produce the surface of household appliances such as fridge and microwave oven. In transportation, color coated panels are applied to the production and processing of oil pan, automotive interior parts and so on.
彩涂板市场用途主要分为建筑、家电和交通运输等三部分，其中建筑领域所占比例大，家电业次之 ，交通运输业只占较少一部分。建筑用彩涂板一般以热镀锌钢板和热镀铝锌钢板为基板，主要加工成瓦楞板或 与聚氨酯符合夹芯板后，用于建造钢结构厂房、机场、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶、墙面、门。家 电彩板一般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，用于生产冰箱和大型空调系统，冰柜、面包机、家具等。交通运输业上一 般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，主要用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等。	The use of color coating board is mainly divided into three parts, such as construction, household appliances and transportation, among which the proportion of the construction field is large, the household appliance industry is the second, and the transportation industry is only a small part. The color coated plates are usually made of hot-dip galvanized steel plate and hot plated aluminum zinc plate, which are mainly processed into corrugated boards or polyurethane conforms to sandwich panels, and are used to build roofs, walls and doors for industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, airports, storeroom, freezers and so on. Home appliance color boards are usually made of galvanized and cold plate as substrates. They are used for producing refrigerators and large air conditioning systems, freezers, bakery, furniture and so on. In transportation industry, zinc plating and cold plate are commonly used as substrates, which are mainly used for oil pan, automotive interior decorations, etc.
彩涂板彩涂卷使用镀锌钢板为基板的彩色涂 层钢板，除有锌保护外，锌层上的有机涂层起了覆盖隔离作用 ，可防止钢板生锈，使用寿命比镀锌钢板更长，据介绍涂层钢板的使用寿命比镀锌钢板长50%。	In addition to zinc protection, the organic coating on the zinc coating can prevent the steel plate from rusting, and the service life is longer than that of the galvanized steel plate. It is introduced that the service life of the coated steel plate is 50% longer than that of the galvanized steel plate.
但是，在不同的地区和不同的使用部位，采用相同镀锌量、同种涂料、相同涂层厚度的彩色涂层板，其使 用寿命会有很大的不同。例如，在工业区或沿海地区，由于受到空气中二氧化硫气体或盐分的作用，腐蚀速度 加快，使用寿命受到影响。	However, in different areas and different parts of use, the use of the same coating, the same coating, the same coating thickness of color coating board, the service life will be very different. For example, in industrial or coastal areas, due to the role of sulfur dioxide gas or salt in the air, the corrosion rate is accelerated and the service life is affected.
市场上的彩涂板大多都是用于建筑行业，也有极少的一部分会用于其他行业，比如说航空领域、交通运输行业等等，这也就意味着彩涂板对于建筑行业的重要性，也可以说是不可替代了。不过，作为普通人的我们，可以不需要太了解关于彩涂板的知识，只需要知道彩涂板是什么，在彩涂板市场上有什么重要的用途就行了。	Most of the color coating board in the market is used in the construction industry, and a few parts will be used in other industries, such as the aviation industry, transportation and so on, which means that the color coating board is important to the construction industry, and it can be said to be irreplaceable. However, as the ordinary people, we do not need to know much about the color coating plate knowledge, only need to know what color coating is, what important use in the color coating market.
钢结构工程施工质量控制要点	Key points of construction quality control of steel structure engineering
随着现代经济的不断发展，钢结构工程以其施工速度快、周期短、强度高、便于预制、安装、适用高层大跨度等的优越性已在工程领域广泛应用。而过去，我国大量采用钢筋混凝土结构和预应力混凝土结构，现场工程技术人员比较缺乏钢结构工程的施工经验，施工质量的好坏直接影响工程结构的安全。因而，钢结构工程的质量问题也越来越引起人们的重视，因此加强钢结构工程施工质量控制，具有很重要的现实意义和必要性。	With the continuous development of modern economy, steel structure engineering has been widely used in engineering field for its advantages of fast construction, short period, high strength, easy to prefabricate, install, and apply high rise and large span. In the past, a large number of reinforced concrete structures and prestressed concrete structures were used in our country. The field engineering technicians lack the construction experience of steel structure engineering. The quality of construction directly affects the safety of the engineering structure. Therefore, the quality of the steel structure engineering has been paid more and more attention. Therefore, it is of great practical significance and necessity to strengthen the quality control of the construction of the steel structure.
施工质量控制要点	Key points of construction quality control

施工准备	Construction preparation
施工准备是建设施工创造必须条件，认真、细致、深入地做好施工准备工作，对充分发挥人的积极因素，合理组织人力、物力，加快工程进度，提供施工质量，节约投资和材料，对顺利完成钢结构建设任务起着重要的作用。	Construction preparation is a necessary condition for construction and construction. It is serious, meticulous and thorough to do a good job of construction preparation. It plays an important role in the successful completion of the construction of steel structure by giving full play to the positive factors of human beings, organizing the manpower and material resources reasonably, speeding up the project progress, providing the quality of construction, saving the investment and materials.
1.1认真做好施工图纸的会审和交底工作	1.1 Conferencing and submitting construction drawings
图纸是工程施工的依据，工程项目技术负责人应组织有关技术人员对图纸进行分工审阅和消化，其目的一是使施工单位和各参建单位熟悉设计图纸，了解工程特点和设计意图，找出需要解决的技术难题，并制定解决方案；二是为了解决图纸中存在的问题，减少图纸的差错，将图纸中的质量隐患消灭在萌芽之中。同时做好技术交底，做好施工和设计的结合、做好钢结构吊装与土建施工、钢结构和混凝土构预制的结合。	The drawings are the basis for the construction of the project. The technical officer of the engineering project should organize the technical personnel to examine and digest the drawings. The purpose of the drawings is to make the construction units and all the construction units familiar with the design drawings, to understand the engineering characteristics and the design intentions, to find out the technical problems to be solved and to formulate the solutions; two, In order to solve the problems in the drawings, reduce the errors in the drawings, eliminate the hidden dangers in the drawings. At the same time, we should make good technical disclosure, do well the combination of construction and design, do well in the combination of steel structure hoisting and civil construction, steel structure and precast concrete structure.
1.2认真编制钢结构工程施工组织设计	1.2 carefully compile the construction organization design of steel structure engineering
施工组织设计是施工单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，是一个科学的管理方法。施工单位在编制施工组织和施工方案时，须从人、机、料、法、环五个方面制定切实可行的具体实施细则，落实计划，落实组织人员，落实自检、互检和专检，把容易出现的质量问题全部纳入受控状态，确保方案技术措施得力、可行。在编制和贯彻施工组织设计过程中应做到广泛深入的研究，向施工人员交底，做到人人把关。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计。其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施。钢结构安装工程施工组织设计内容有质量保证体系和技术管理体系的建立、质量、进度控制的措施和方法、施工工期的安排等。	The construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document directed by the construction unit to guide the activities in the whole construction process, and is a scientific management method. In the preparation of construction organization and construction plan, the construction unit must formulate practical and concrete implementation rules from five aspects: human, machine, material, law and ring, implement the plan, implement the organization personnel, implement self inspection, mutual inspection and special inspection, and bring all the quality problems that are easy to be brought into the controlled state, and ensure that the technical and technical measures of the program are right. It is feasible. In the process of compiling and carrying out the construction organization design, extensive and thorough research should be done, and the bottom line should be laid down to the construction staff. For steel structure engineering, the manufacturing process and installation construction organization design should be worked out for the production stage and the installation stage respectively. The production process should include the working procedure of the production stage, the quality standard of each sub item, the technical requirement, and the specific measures to ensure the quality of the product. The construction organization and design of the steel structure installation project include the establishment of quality assurance system and technology management system, the measures and methods for quality and progress control, and the arrangement of construction period.

重视钢结构基础工程的质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of steel structure foundation engineering
钢结构基础工程的质量控制一般指钢结构基础预埋螺栓的质量控制，预埋螺栓是整个工程施工的第一步，也是非常关键的一步，是整个工程的基础。施工基础预埋螺栓时首先熟悉图纸，了解图纸的意图，应制作安装模板。预埋螺栓用两安装模板及钢筋定位在柱子的主筋和模板上，保证预埋螺栓不受土建浇注混凝土施工而移位。这样每组螺栓之间的间距、高低可控制在允许的误差范围内；同时，保护好螺栓丝扣，在混凝土浇筑时不被损坏。土建工程完工后，用经纬仪和水准仪对地脚螺栓的标高、轴线进行复查，并做好记录。并交下一道工序验收。	The quality control of the foundation engineering of steel structure generally refers to the quality control of the pre buried bolt of the steel structure. The pre buried bolt is the first step of the whole construction and a very critical step, and it is the foundation of the whole project. When the foundation bolts are embedded in the construction foundation, the drawings should be familiar with the intention of the drawings first, and the installation template should be made. The embedded bolts are positioned on the main reinforcement and the formwork of the column with two installation formwork and reinforcing bars to ensure that the embedded bolts are not moved by the construction of the pouring concrete. In this way, the spacing and height between the bolts of each group can be controlled within the allowable error range. At the same time, the bolt threads can not be damaged when the concrete is poured. After completion of the civil engineering, the elevation and axis of the anchor bolts should be reviewed with theodolite and level. And submit a procedure for acceptance.

钢结构制作工程质量控制	Quality control of steel construction engineering
钢结构工程的施工通常要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段。钢结构工程有大部分时间是在工厂车间内部进行，由于钢结构构件在工厂内加工制造的质量好坏，对钢结构工程的现场安装及整体结构的安全稳定至关重要。因此钢结构制作生产厂家必须具备相应企业资质、生产规模、技术能力、机械设备及先进的工艺水平。	The construction of steel structure usually has two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. The steel structure works most of the time in the factory workshop, because the quality of the steel structure components manufacturing in the factory is very important to the site installation and the safety and stability of the overall structure of the steel structure engineering. Therefore, manufacturers of steel structure must have corresponding qualification, production scale, technical capability, mechanical equipment and advanced technological level.
钢结构一般制作工艺流程分为:放样→下料→拼板→切割→组立→埋弧焊接→钻孔→组装→矫正成型→铆工零配件下料→制作组装→焊接和焊接检验→防锈处理、涂装、编号→构件验收出厂。在钢结构制作中，应根据钢结构制作工艺流程，抓住关键工序进行质量控制，如控制关键零件的加工，主要构件的工艺、措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	The general production process of steel structure is divided into three parts: layout, blanking, cutting board, cutting, assembling, submerged arc welding, drilling, assembling, correction forming, riveting and assembling, making and assembling, welding and welding inspection, rust prevention treatment, painting, numbering and acceptance of the factory. In the production of steel structure, the process flow should be made according to the steel structure, and the quality control is carried out by the key process, such as the processing of the key parts, the process and measures of the main components, the processing equipment and the process equipment.

重视焊接工程质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of welding engineering
在钢结构制作和安装工程工程中焊接工程是最重要的环节，必须重视焊接工程质量控制。目前，钢结构在生产过程中大部分采用具自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，个别部位采用手工施焊。	Welding engineering is the most important part in the fabrication and installation of steel structures, and the quality control of welding engineering must be emphasized. At present, most of the steel structures are equipped with automatic submerged arc welding machines, partly equipped with semi automatic gas shielded welding machines, and some parts are manually welded.
焊接质量问题较多存在于手工焊缝，这些问题有：焊瘤、夹渣、气孔、没焊透、咬边、错边、焊缝尺寸偏差大、不用引弧板、焊接变形不矫正、飞溅物清理不净等。鉴于这种情况，钢结构施焊前，对焊条的合格证要进行检查，按说明书要求使用，焊工必须持证上岗证，焊缝表面不得有裂纹	There are many problems of welding quality in hand weld, such as welding, slag, gas hole, no penetration, bite, wrong side, large deviation of weld size, no arc plate, no correction of welding deformation and clean spatter. In view of this situation, before the steel structure is welded, the qualification certificate for the welding rod should be checked, and the welder must be certificated with the certificate, and there shall be no cracks on the surface of the weld.
单层厂房钢结构的组成	Composition of steel structure of single storey factory building
厂房结构的组成	The composition of the structure of the factory building
单层厂房钢结构一般是由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架、柱、吊车梁、制动梁（或桁架）、各种支撑以及墙架等构件组成的空间刚性骨架	Steel structure workshop is generally composed of purlin, roof rack, roof, bracket, column, crane beam, brake beam (or truss), space rigid frame and various supporting wall frame components
这些构件按其作用，可归并成下列体系：	These components can be incorporated into the following systems according to their functions:
(1) 横向平面框架——是厂房的基本承重结构，由柱和横梁（屋架）组成。承受作用在厂房的横向水平荷载和竖向荷载并传递到基础。	(1) the horizontal plane frame, the basic load-bearing structure of the plant, is composed of columns and beams (roof frames). The lateral horizontal load and vertical load of the plant are transmitted to the foundation.
(2) 纵向平面框架——由柱、托架、吊车梁及柱间支撑等构成。其作用是保证厂房骨架的纵向不可变形和刚度，承受纵向水平荷载（吊车的纵向制动力、纵向风力等）并传递到基础。	(2) longitudinal plane frame is composed of columns, brackets, columns between crane beam support. Its function is to ensure the vertical deformation and stiffness of the workshop skeleton, and to bear the longitudinal horizontal load (the longitudinal braking force and longitudinal wind force) of the crane, and transmit it to the foundation.
(3) 屋盖系统——由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架及屋盖支撑等构成。	(3) - roof system composed of purlin, roof rack, roof and roof support bracket, etc..
(4) 吊车梁及制动梁——主要承受吊车的竖向荷载和水平荷载，并传递到横向框架和纵向框架。	(4) the crane beam and the brake beam, which mainly bear the vertical load and horizontal load of the crane, are transferred to the transverse frame and the longitudinal frame.
(5) 支撑——包括屋盖支撑、柱间支撑及其它附加支撑。其作用是将单独的平面框架连成空间体系，以保证结构具有必要的刚度和稳定性，同时也有承受风力及吊车制动力的作用。	(5) support, including roof support, inter column support and other additional support. Its function is to connect a separate plane frame into a space system, so as to ensure that the structure has the necessary stiffness and stability, and also has the function of bearing the power of wind and crane.
(6) 墙架——承受墙体的重量和风力。	(6) a wall frame - bearing the weight of the wall and the wind.
此外，还有一些次要的构件如工作平台、梯子、门窗等。	In addition, there are some minor components, such as work platforms, ladders, doors and windows, etc.
各种构件的用钢量占整个厂房钢结构的总用钢量的比值大致如表所示。	The ratio of steel amount to the total amount of steel used for the entire steel structure of the whole plant is roughly as shown in the table.
厂房按单位面积计算的用钢量，是评定设计的经济合理性的一项重要指标。各类厂房单位面积用钢量的统计数值见下表	The amount of steel used in the workshop by unit area is an important index for evaluating the economic rationality of the design. The statistical value of the amount of steel used in the unit area of all kinds of workshops is shown in the following table
柱的类型	Type of column
柱按结构形式可分为：等截面柱和阶形柱。	The column can be divided into the same section column and the order column according to the structure form.
柱按柱的截面形式分为：实腹式柱和格构式柱。	The column is divided into the concrete column and the lattice column according to the cross section of the column.
柱脚按结构内力的边界条件划分，可分为铰接柱脚和刚性固定柱脚两大类。铰接柱脚仅传递竖向荷载和水平荷载，刚性固定柱脚除传递竖向和水平荷载外，还传递弯矩。刚性固定柱脚就其构造形式可分为三种形式：露出式柱脚、埋入式或插入式柱脚、外包式柱脚。按柱脚的结构形式则可分为整体式柱脚和分离式柱脚。	The column divided by boundary conditions of the internal force of the structure, can be divided into rigid fixed hinged column and column two categories. The hinged column transfer only vertical load and horizontal load, rigid fixed base in addition to transfer of vertical and horizontal loads, but also transfer moment. The structural form of rigid fixed base can be divided into three forms: a type of embedded column, or insert column, column foot. According to the structure of the form of the column can be divided into integral column and separated column.
钢柱的安装方法一般采用三种方法，即采用钢垫板方案、座浆垫板方案和调平螺帽与调平钢板方案。	Three methods are generally used for the installation of steel columns, that is, the steel cushion plate, the slurry cushion and the flat plate and the leveling steel plate.
构件工地拼装	Component site assembly
构件拼装是将若干个分段构件或单件，按设计要求在地面装配成完整的构件或构件组合体。	Component assembly is to assemble a number of piecewise components or single pieces to be assembled into complete components or component combinations on the ground according to the design requirements.
(1) 单一构件拼装	(1) single component assembly
1). 钢柱拼装	1). Steel column assembly
大型钢柱一般在变截面处或肩梁上部分段，进行分段运输。工地拼装后，用焊接或高强度螺栓连接，组成整根柱子进行吊装。	Large steel columns are generally segmented at the variable section or on the upper part of the shoulder beam for subsection transportation. After the construction site is assembled, the whole root column is hoisted with welded or high strength bolts.
首先在一条轴线上设置拼装台架，将钢柱下段吊放到台架上，垫平并确定中心线，再将柱的上段吊放到连接处，使两节柱插接端对准，拼接到位，仔细校准柱的中心轴线和长度尺寸等后，即可按图纸要求进行焊接或高强度螺栓连接固定。	First set the assembling bench at an axis on the steel column under section dipping to bench pad and determine the center line, then the upper column dipping into joints, the two column inserted end alignment, stitching in place, carefully calibrated column size and the length of the central axis, can according to the requirements of the drawings welding or high strength bolt connection fixation.
2). 钢屋架及天窗架拼装	2). Assembly of steel roof truss and skylight frame
一般采用平拼法，即将分块构件平卧于拼装平台上拼装。在起重机性能允许的条件下还可以将天窗架与屋架构件拼装成一体。拼装钢桁架时，要严格控制跨度误差和扭曲，使其不超出允许值。在翻转桁架时，为了防止变形，应确定合理的吊点，必要时还要进行临时加固。	Generally, the flat method is used, which is about to lie on the assembly platform. In the crane performance under permissible conditions can also be integrated with the roof member day window frame assembly. When the steel truss is assembled, the span error and distortion should be strictly controlled so that it does not exceed the allowable value. In order to prevent the deformation of the truss, a reasonable lifting point should be determined and temporary reinforcement should be carried out when necessary.
对于有天窗的大跨度屋架或高度较大的桁架，应用立拼法拼装，因为这种桁架的翻转是非常困难的。	For a large span roof truss with a skylight or a high height truss, a spelling spelling is applied, because the flipping of this truss is very difficult.
(1) 构件组合拼装	(1) component assembly and assembly
当具备大型起重机械，且按照条件允许时，可将诸多构件在地面拼装成一个稳定单元块体，进行整体吊装。这样可减少高空作业，有利于安全施工和提高工作效率，保证构件吊装的稳定性。例如两榀屋架与斜撑组合拼装、斜桥构架及通廊桁架组合拼装等。	When a large lifting machine is available and the conditions permit, a number of components can be assembled into a stable unit block on the ground to be hoisted as a whole. In this way, the operation of high altitude can be reduced, the safety construction and the efficiency of work can be improved, and the stability of the hoisting of the components is ensured. For example, two pieces of roof and brace assembly, bridge frame and truss corridor assembly etc..
构件组合拼装在安装现场进行，拼装位置必须在安装起重机的作用范围内。拼装的项目和规模必须根据起重机的性能、构件的强度、刚度、稳定性及施工环境等因素确定。	The component assembly is assembled at the installation site, and the assembly position must be within the scope of the installation of the crane. The project and scale of the assembly must be determined according to the performance of the crane, the strength of the component, the stiffness, the stability and the construction environment.

如何避开彩钢屋顶漏水？	How to avoid the leakage of the color steel roof?
目前彩钢金属板被广泛应用于家庭自搭结构顶板，如自封飘窗顶、自搭房屋面。	At present, the color steel plate is widely used in the family roof structure, such as self sealing ceiling and self building.
在北方与彩钢板搭接的房屋原有立墙结构往往存在保温构造层，而后搭设的金属板材与墙体多数只是对接，未对结构墙面进行任何开槽固定等处理，在后期使用中因受风雨侵蚀、温度变化及使用年限影响，搭接部位密封不严实等很容易造成渗漏问题。	The structure of the original vertical wall structure of the building in the north and the colored steel plate often exists the thermal insulation layer, and the metal plate and the wall are only butted, and the structure wall is not fixed. In the later use, the lap parts are sealed because of the influence of the wind and rain erosion, the temperature change and the service life. It is easy to cause leakage.
↑↑涂刷沥青维修↑↑	Repair of bitumen
为避免渗漏问题发生或者渗漏后进行维修治理的方法各有不同，各出奇招，打发泡胶密封、涂刷沥青材料、卷材覆盖等等，但其防水治理效果也不尽相同，有些方法可能只是解一时之需，无法达到长期治理、补漏的效果。	In order to avoid leakage or leakage, the methods of maintenance and treatment are different. They are different, they send out the bubble gum seal, the bitumen material, the roll cover and so on. But the effect of waterproof treatment is not the same, some methods may only solve the temporary needs, and can not reach the effect of long-term treatment and leakage.
↓↓卷材覆盖维修↓↓	Cover maintenance
由于搭设的彩钢板多为彩钢夹芯板，即两层成型金属面板和中间发泡、熟化成型的泡沫、岩棉或其他隔热内芯组成。为有效密封搭接缝并防止雨水从板材缝隙向下部保温层串水，需对渗漏的彩钢板整体进行防水防护处理。	The color steel plate is mostly made of color steel sandwich panels, which is composed of two layers forming metal panels and intermediate foams, cured foams, rock wool or other heat insulation inner cores. In order to effectively seal the joints and prevent rainwater from the seam to the lower insulation layer, it is necessary to protect the leaked color steel sheet as a whole.

基层清理	Grass-roots cleaning
大面清理浮灰，板材局部除锈打磨；	Large surface cleaning ash, plate partial rust and grinding;
3	Three
密封处理	Sealing treatment
扣板接缝、墙体结构交接部位重新打胶密封，并采用防水堵漏宝修补、抹弧；	The joint of the buckle plate and the wall structure is re glued and sealed.
4	Four
基层涂抹	Base coating
采用柔韧型防水涂料（如雨虹吉仕涂101）进行打底，薄涂一至两遍；	Use flexible waterproof coating (such as Yu Hong Shi Shi Tu 101) to underlay and spread it to two times.
5	Five
细部附加层	Detail additional layer
彩钢交接部位采用好仕涂屋面高弹防水涂料薄刷一层，然后铺贴网格布，保证其平整，无褶皱、翘边，最后在网格布上部涂刷好仕涂屋面高弹防水涂料，完全覆盖网格布。	At the junction of color steel, the high elastic and waterproof coating on the top of the roof of the color steel is used, and then the grid cloth is put up to ensure its smoothness, no wrinkles and warping edges. Finally, the high projectile waterproof coating on the roof of the grid cloth is painted on the upper part of the grid cloth, and the mesh cloth is completely covered.
6	Six
大面涂刷防水涂料	Waterproofing coating with large surface brush
彩钢板整体涂刷防水涂刷屋面高弹，厚度达到1.5mm，要求薄涂多遍，每遍防水涂膜完全干燥后在进行下一遍涂膜施工。	The waterproof coating of the color steel plate is highly projectile with a thickness of 1.5mm, which requires a thin coating of thin coating, and the coating is carried out for the next time after the waterproof coating is completely dried.
工业厂房、仓库	Industrial buildings and warehouses
彩钢夹芯板主要应用于工业厂房、仓库的屋面和外墙。过去的工业厂房屋面多采用预制混凝土板或石棉板。随着轻钢结构的迅速推广，夹芯板也以其多项显著的优势取代了上述2种材料。	Color steel sandwich panels are mainly used in industrial buildings, roofs and external walls of warehouses. In the past, prefabricated concrete boards or asbestos boards were used in the roofs of industrial buildings. With the rapid expansion of the light steel structure, the 2 kinds of materials have been replaced by the sandwich panels with a number of significant advantages.
在提供更好隔热效果的同时，夹芯板配合已成熟发展的轻钢结构，能够真正体现轻钢体系轻质、快速高效、布置灵活等一系列优势，因而在目前的单层厂房建筑中已成为首选的方案。	While providing better insulation effect, sandwich panels, combined with the developed lightweight steel structure, can truly represent a series of advantages such as lightweight, fast and efficient layout and flexible layout of light steel system, so it has become the first choice in the current single story factory building.
而对于多层工业厂房，除了顶屋的屋面可采用夹芯板外，外墙也可利用夹芯板作灵活的布置，通过彩涂板多变的色彩和形状达到美化建筑外观的目的。对于恒温恒湿要求的工业建筑，采用热工性能优于砖墙的夹芯板作为围护材料，可大大节约建成后的运营成本。	For multi-storey industrial buildings, besides the roof, the roof can be made of sandwich panels. The outer wall can also be flexibly arranged by sandwich panels, and the purpose of beautifying the architectural appearance can be achieved by changing the color and shape of the color coated boards. For the industrial buildings with constant temperature and humidity requirements, the sandwich panels with the thermal performance superior to the brick wall are used as enclosure materials, which can greatly save the operation cost after the completion of the construction.
公共建筑	Public buildings
彩钢夹芯板主要可应用于有大空间需要的公共建筑的屋面和外墙中，如：机制、车站的候机或候车大厅，体育场馆、影剧院和礼堂、展览馆和会展中心、博物馆，等等。	The color steel sandwich panels can be mainly applied to the roofs and exterior walls of public buildings with large space requirements, such as mechanism, station waiting or waiting hall, stadiums, theaters and auditorium, exhibition centers and exhibition centers, museums and so on.
公共建筑由于具有需提供更大的空间、有室内空调、防火等一系列比工业厂房更高要求的特点，目前此类建筑多采用网架或管桁架的屋架结构形式，因此对屋面板的材料在轻质、保温和隔热、防火安全、防水、吸声、耐久性等方面都提出了更高的要求。	Because of the public buildings need to provide more space, indoor air conditioning, fire and a series of industrial buildings than the higher requirements of the characteristics of roof structure the building adopts the grid or pipe truss, the roofing material in light weight, heat preservation and heat insulation, fire prevention, waterproof, sound absorption, durability and safety other aspects are put forward higher requirements.
钢结构工程的施工	Construction of steel structure engineering
1、要切实作好钢结构制作及安装单位的考察与选择工作	1. The investigation and selection of the production and installation units of the steel structure should be conscientiously done.
我们知道，钢结构工程的施工要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，这两个阶段可由一个施工单位完成，但有时也可能由两个单位分别完成（分包）。切实作好钢结构制作单位和安装单位的考察与选择工作，对于确保钢结构工程质量及进度，具有重要意义。钢结构制作、安装单位的考察内容主要有：企业资质，生产规模，技术人员数量、职称及履历，技术工人数量及资格证，机械设备情况，以及业绩情况等级。点这免费下载施工技术资料	As we know, the construction of steel structure has to go through two stages: Factory fabrication and on-site installation. These two stages can be completed by a construction unit, but sometimes it can be completed by two units separately. It is of great significance to ensure the quality and progress of the steel structure engineering by making a good work on the inspection and selection of the production units and installation units of steel structures. The research contents of the production and installation of steel structure mainly include: enterprise qualification, production scale, number of technical personnel, professional title and resume, number of technical workers, qualification certificates, machinery and equipment, and performance level. Point this free downloading of construction technical data
2、严格审查承包单位提交的钢结构制作工艺及安装施工组织设计	2. Strictly examine the design of the steel construction technology and the installation and construction organization submitted by the contractor
施工组织设计是承包单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，认真审查施工组织设计是监理工作事前控制和主动控制的重要内容。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计，其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施，如关键零件的加工方法，主要构件的工艺流程、工艺措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document guiding the Contractor's activities in the whole construction process. The careful review of construction organization design is an important part of pre control and active control in supervision work. Steel structure engineering for production and installation stage respectively in the preparation of construction organization design and installation of production process, the production process includes the production stage of each process and each sub quality standards, technical requirements, and to ensure the quality of products and to develop the specific measures, such as the key parts of the processing method, technological process, main component the process measures, processing equipment, the process equipment etc..
3、要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作	3, we should pay full attention to the supervision work in the production stage
如前所述，钢结构工程均要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，而制作和安装一般是由钢结构工程公司下属的两个基层单位（制作车间和安装项目部）分别负责，有时还可能由制造厂和安装公司两个单位分别完成（分包）。监理工程师要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作，要象其他类型工程的监理工作一样，切实搞好事前控制和事中控制，对各工序、各分项都要做到检查认真而及时、严格而到位。要避免那种放松工厂制作过程的监理，仅靠构件完成后进场验收的错误工作方法。这一点在制作单位距工程所在地路程较远的情况下，尤其要注意。	As mentioned earlier, the steel structure engineering must pass through factory production and installation of two stages, and the production and installation is two units under the steel structure engineering company (production workshop and installation project department) are responsible for, and sometimes were completed by the factory and the company installed two units (including package). The supervision engineer should pay enough attention to the supervision work in the production stage, like the supervision work of other types of projects, do well the control before and in the middle affairs, and check every process and sub item strictly, timely and strictly. It is necessary to avoid the supervision of the process of relaxing factory production, and the wrong method of working for the post acceptance check only by the component. This point should be paid attention to in the case that the production unit is far away from the site of the project.
4、安装阶段的监理	4, the supervision of the installation stage
钢结构安装阶段的监理工作内容主要是监督承包单位内部管理体系和质保体系的运行情况，督促落实施工组织设计的各项技术、组织措施，严格按照国家现行钢结构有关规范、标准进行施工。钢结构安装阶段的监理工作应重点抓好以下几个环节：安装方案的合理性和落实情况、安装测量、高强度螺栓的连接、安装焊接质量、安装尺寸偏差的实测、涂装等。监理工作要加强现场巡视检查、平行检验和旁站监督，尤其是在目前部分钢结构施工单位素质偏低，施工仍欠规范的情况下，切实做好现场巡视和旁站，对于确保钢结构工程的施工质量，更有现实意义。	The supervision work of steel structure installation stage is the main operation of the supervision contractor internal management system and quality assurance system, supervise the implementation of the technology, organization design measures of construction, the construction in strict accordance with the current national norms and standards of steel structure. During the installation phase of steel structure, we should focus on the following aspects: the rationality and implementation of installation plan, installation and measurement, connection of high-strength bolts, installation and welding quality, installation size deviation measurement and painting. To strengthen the supervision of site inspection, site of parallel inspection and supervision, especially in the current unit part of steel structure construction quality is low, the construction is still owed norms, to do on-site inspection and supervision, to ensure the construction quality of steel structure engineering, more practical significance.
5、关于钢结构工程的试验检测工作	5. On testing and testing of steel structure engineering
钢结构工程的制作及安装施工的多项试验检测工作是一般土建工程所没有的，这些试验检测项目主要有：钢材原材有关项目的检测（必要时），焊接工艺评定试验（必要时），焊缝无损检测（超声波、X射线、磁粉等）、高强度螺栓扭矩系数或预拉力试验、高强度螺栓连接面抗滑移系数检测、钢网架节点承载力试验、钢结构防火涂料性能试验等。	Production and installation of the number of test work of steel structure engineering is the general civil engineering does not, these test items include: detection of steel raw material of the project (if necessary), welding procedure qualification test (if necessary), non destructive testing of weld (super sonic, X ray, magnetic powder, etc.) the strength of bolt torque coefficient or pre tension test, high strength bolt connection surface detection, anti slip coefficient of steel truss joint bearing capacity test and performance test of steel structure fire retardant coating.
作好这些试验、检测工作要注意以下几点：	The following points should be paid attention to in doing these tests and testing.
（1）要监督委托有相应资质的检测机构进行；	(1) to supervise the inspection agencies entrusted with corresponding qualifications;
（2）要坚持取样、送检的见证制度，要避免试件与工程不一致现象；	(2) we should adhere to the witness system of sampling and inspection, and avoid the inconsistency between the test pieces and the project.
（3）对于部分检测项目，具有相应资质的检测机构较少，路程较远，且费用较高，在这种情况下，监理工程师必须坚持原则，态度明确，立场坚定，及时督促承包单位落实这些工作，这是确保钢结构制作与安装质量及施工进度的必要措施，也是国家现行钢结构工程施工质量验收规范规定的“主控项目”。	(3) for some test items, with the corresponding qualification testing organization is less, the distance, and the cost is higher, in this case, the engineer must adhere to the principle of a clear attitude, stand firm, to urge the contractor to implement these work, it is necessary to ensure the measures of steel structure fabrication and installation quality and construction schedule the main control program, the current national regulations and steel structure construction quality acceptance "".
6、钢结构工程其它几个重要质量控制点	6. Some other important quality control points for steel structure engineering
6.1 地脚螺栓的预埋	The preembedding of 6.1 anchor bolts
地脚螺栓的预埋质量直接影响钢结构的安装质量，控制好地脚螺栓（群）的位置、垂直度、长度和标高，对于减少扩孔及调整工作量（甚至避免返工），提高结构安装质量具有重要意义。地脚螺栓的预埋方法可采用直接预埋法，也可采用预留孔法。基础砼浇筑前监理工程师必须严格检查预埋螺栓施工方法的合理性、可靠性，以及各项实测指标是否在规范规定范围内。点这免费下载施工技术资料	The embedment quality of anchor bolts directly affects the installation quality of steel structures. Controlling the location, perpendicularity, length and elevation of anchor bolts is of great significance for reducing reaming and adjusting workload, or even avoiding rework, and improving the quality of structure installation. The pre embedding method of the anchor bolts can be used directly, and the reserved hole method can be used. Before the foundation concrete is poured, the supervision engineer must strictly check the rationality and reliability of the construction method of the embedded bolts, and whether the measured indicators are within the prescribed limits.

6.2 焊接工程质量控制	6.2 quality control of welding engineering
焊接工程是钢结构制作和安装工程最重要的分项之一，监理工程师必须从事前准备，施焊过程和成品检验各个环节，切实作好焊接工程的质量控制工作。目前，我市钢结构施工单位绝大部分都具备自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，仅在个	Welding engineering is one of the most important sub items in the fabrication and installation works of steel structure. The supervision engineer must engage in the preparation, welding process and inspection of finished products, and do well the quality control work of welding engineering. At present, most of the construction units of steel structure in our city have automatic submerged arc welding machines, some of which have semi-automatic gas protection welding machines.
集装箱活动房安装的误区	Misconceptions in installation of container movable rooms
大家在安装集装箱活动房的时候，一定要注意这几大误区：	When installing container activities rooms, we must pay attention to these misunderstandings.
误区1：彩钢房檩条设计尺寸与安装尺寸实际不符，对于集装箱房安装过程中与设计方案尺寸不符，平时不要小看这个安装细节，安装不好轻则对屋面板变型，重则对房屋倒塌，	Mistake 1: Color steel house purlins design size and installation size does not conform to the actual, for the container room installation process and design plan size does not conform to the usual installation details, do not underestimate this installation, installation is not good light on the roof deck deformation, heavy on the collapse of the house.
改正1：当钢架安装完毕后，确保万一，从檩条边到中准确测量实际尺寸，将彩钢板尺寸加工好既就安装。	Correction 1: When the steel frame is installed, make sure that in case the actual size is accurately measured from purlin side to middle, the color steel plate size is machined and installed.
误区2：盲目的用材	Myth 2: blind timber
工程进场，起初基础刚刚做好，就大量的将材料运进工地，易造成安装不便、材料多少也会沾上泥巴，造成起初预备的材料进场方案。	As soon as the foundation is finished, a large number of materials will be transported to the site, which will easily cause inconvenience in installation and mud on the amount of materials, resulting in the initial preparation of the material admission scheme.
改正2：用材要按照流程：1.锚栓进场，2.钢柱、济宁彩钢房钢梁及钢构配件进场，3.彩钢进场，4.门窗进场及防水材料。按照以上几点流程有可效的保护安装不便、沾泥巴等。	Correction 2: Material to follow the process: 1. Anchor bolt into the field, 2. Steel columns, Jining color steel house steel beams and steel components into the field, 3. color steel into the field, 4. doors and windows into the field and waterproof materials. According to the above process, effective protection, installation inconvenience, mud and so on.
误区3：私自更改彩钢房设计方案	Misunderstanding 3: privately change the design scheme of color steel housing
通常安装工人为了节省工期，往往不按设计方案安装，私自更改彩钢房设计方案，将设计方案简单化。	Usually, in order to save time, installation workers often do not install according to the design scheme, alter the design scheme of the color steel house privately, and simplify the design scheme.
改正3：乙方在与安装工人安装前必须对安装工人讲明设计方案的重要性，以免工人偷工减料，使结构稳定性不受保障。	Correction 3: Party B must explain the importance of the design scheme to the installation workers before installing with the installation workers, so as to avoid jerry-building and material reduction, so that the structural stability is not guaranteed.
钢结构制作质量未达到要求的表现	The quality of steel structure is not up to the required performance.
1切割、下料	1 cutting and blanking
在切割、下料时，翼缘板尺寸宽窄不一，造成H型钢与牛腿的尺寸不一致，与牛腿联系的钢梁上下翼缘板错位约一个板厚；切割边缘有较深的切痕，板边有明显的凹陷，或有较深的锯齿印，切割粗糙度超标，拼板边缘切割不垂直度，拼接错边等超标。	When cutting and cutting, the width of flange plate is different, resulting in the size of H-beam and corbel is not consistent, and the upper and lower flange plate of the steel beam connected with corbel is about one plate thickness; the cutting edge has deep notch, the edge of the plate has obvious depression, or has deep serrated impression, the cutting roughness exceeds the standard, the edge of the jigsaw cutting is not vertical. Exceed the standard.
2组装	2 assembly
在组装时，焊接H钢无组装胎架，造成H型钢高度尺寸有偏差，腹板偏中心；翼腹板对接后，焊缝未矫平，有明显凹凸；轻钢腹板不平整，组装前未矫正。	When assembling, welded H-steel has no assembled frame, resulting in H-steel height deviation, web deviation center; wing web butt, weld seam is not rectified, there is obvious concavity and convexity; light steel web is not uniform, not rectified before assembling.
3焊接	3 welding
在焊接方面，轻钢焊接H型钢翼板开料后再拼接，焊缝未安装引熄弧板，造成焊缝不饱满，边缘有凹坑未熔合等，与母材不齐平；柱脚、牛腿的焊脚尺寸小于设计图纸的规定，角焊缝塌边现象严重，收弧处普遍低于母材，气孔较多；使用CO2焊的焊缝成形差，宽窄不一致，高低不一致，忽大忽小；手工焊焊缝不直，宽窄不一，咬边现象严重；焊渣飞溅未清除干净。	In welding, the light steel welded H-beam wing plate spliced after cutting material, welded seam did not install arc ignition and extinguishing plate, resulting in insufficient weld, edge pits did not fuse, and the base metal is not even; column foot, bracket foot size is smaller than the design drawings, fillet weld collapsing phenomenon is serious, arc closure is generally lower than the base metal, gas hole is relatively. Many; The weld with CO2 welding is poor in shape, width is not consistent, height is not consistent, big or small; manual welding seam is not straight, width is not the same, the phenomenon of undercutting is serious; welding slag spatter is not clean.
4钻孔	4 drill hole
在钻孔方面，事前未很好会审图纸，在该开单排孔的地方，开了双排孔，结果未补孔就留存在构件上。如柱与牛腿连接处的H型钢为双排孔，而大梁与次梁相同规格的H型钢为单排孔，但开孔时都开了双排孔，安装后影响了强度和外观质量。	As for drilling, the drawings were not well read beforehand, and double rows of holes were opened in the place where the single row of holes were opened. As a result, the holes remained on the components without filling. For example, H-section steel at the joint of column and corbel is double-row hole, while H-section steel of the same specification of main beam and secondary beam is single-row hole, but double-row hole is opened when opening, which affects the strength and appearance quality after installation.
5总装过程	5 assembly process
总装过程中，钢柱牛腿与H型钢梁连接处上下错位，左右错位，未控制好尺寸。	During the assembly process, the top and bottom of the steel column corbel and H-beam are dislocated, left and right are dislocated, and the size is not well controlled.
6除锈与油漆	6 rust removal and paint
除锈与油漆方面：除锈马虎，未达到等级要求，油漆不久就出现返锈、剥落；漆膜厚度不均匀，阳面厚度普遍超厚，可达250μm，但阴面往往在90μm左右（室内漆膜厚度规定为125μm）；油漆前杂质未清除干净，污物多，高低不平，流挂现象较普遍。	Rust removal and paint: rust removal sloppy, did not meet the grade requirements, the paint soon appeared rust back, peeling; paint film thickness is uneven, the thickness of the positive surface is generally super thick, up to 250 microns, but the shade is often around 90 microns (indoor film thickness is set at 125 microns); impurities before the paint is not clean, dirt, uneven, uneven. Flow hanging is more common.
7构件运输存放	7 component transportation storage
在构件运输和堆放过程中，无搁置件垫平堆放，而是随意卸车，杂乱堆放，甚至让构件埋入泥堆水沟中，造成构件变形、碰伤和污染。	In the process of transportation and stacking of components, there is no shelving pad stacking, but random unloading, random stacking, and even let the components buried in the mud pile ditch, resulting in deformation, damage and pollution of components.
8构件出厂	8 component factory
构件出厂时，钢柱、钢梁的中心线标记未标示，相当普遍，给安装施工矫正检测带来困难。	When the components leave the factory, the mark of the center line of the steel column and the steel beam is not marked, which is quite common and brings difficulties to the installation, construction and rectification inspection.
9翼腹板拼接	9 wing web splicing
翼腹板拼接长度不符合要求。如翼板拼接长度不应小于翼板宽度的2倍，翼缘板与腹板拼接焊缝应错开200mm以上，腹板拼接长度不小于600mm。但实际往往未达到上述要求。	The stitching length of web web does not meet the requirements. If the length of flange splicing should not be less than twice the width of flange, flange and web splicing weld should be staggered more than 200 mm, web splicing length should not be less than 600 mm. But the reality often fails to meet the above requirements.
广泛运用到我们的生活中，主要原因还是在于彩涂板具有良好的防腐蚀性能，而且易于加工改造，比其他材质的板材都要轻，所以彩涂板才会在建筑市场上受到极大的重视。那么，彩涂板是什么以及彩涂板市场用途是什么呢?我们一起来看看吧。	Widely used in our life, the main reason is that the color coating plate has good corrosion resistance, and easy to process and transform, lighter than the other materials, so color coating plate will be paid great attention to in the building market. Then, what is the color coated board and the market application of the color coated plate? Let's have a look.
彩涂板市场用途	Market use of color coating board
彩涂板是一种新型的复合材料，有PCM和VCM两种。什么是复合材料呢?想必很多人多它都存在着疑问，复合材料就是由有机高分子、无机非金属或金属等几类不同材料通过复合工艺组合而成的新型材料。	Color coated sheet is a new type of composite material, which has two kinds of PCM and VCM. What is composite material? It is necessary for many people to doubt that the composite material is a new type of material composed of a combination of organic polymer, inorganic nonmetal or metal and other different materials.
彩涂板适用于多的领域，包括建筑、家电和交通运输三部分。在建筑领域，因为彩涂板涂层钢板具有轻质、美观和防腐蚀性能，所以它被广泛用于建造钢结构厂房、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶和墙面。在家电领域，彩涂板用于生产冰箱、微波炉等家电的表面。在交通运输方面，彩涂板被应用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等方面的生产，加工。	Color coated panels are applied to many fields, including building, household appliances and transportation three parts. In the field of architecture, color coated plate coated steel plates are lightweight, beautiful and anticorrosive, so it is widely used to build roofs and walls of industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, storeroom, freezers, and so on. In the field of household appliances, color coated boards are used to produce the surface of household appliances such as fridge and microwave oven. In transportation, color coated panels are applied to the production and processing of oil pan, automotive interior parts and so on.
彩涂板市场用途主要分为建筑、家电和交通运输等三部分，其中建筑领域所占比例大，家电业次之 ，交通运输业只占较少一部分。建筑用彩涂板一般以热镀锌钢板和热镀铝锌钢板为基板，主要加工成瓦楞板或 与聚氨酯符合夹芯板后，用于建造钢结构厂房、机场、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶、墙面、门。家 电彩板一般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，用于生产冰箱和大型空调系统，冰柜、面包机、家具等。交通运输业上一 般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，主要用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等。	The use of color coating board is mainly divided into three parts, such as construction, household appliances and transportation, among which the proportion of the construction field is large, the household appliance industry is the second, and the transportation industry is only a small part. The color coated plates are usually made of hot-dip galvanized steel plate and hot plated aluminum zinc plate, which are mainly processed into corrugated boards or polyurethane conforms to sandwich panels, and are used to build roofs, walls and doors for industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, airports, storeroom, freezers and so on. Home appliance color boards are usually made of galvanized and cold plate as substrates. They are used for producing refrigerators and large air conditioning systems, freezers, bakery, furniture and so on. In transportation industry, zinc plating and cold plate are commonly used as substrates, which are mainly used for oil pan, automotive interior decorations, etc.
彩涂板彩涂卷使用镀锌钢板为基板的彩色涂 层钢板，除有锌保护外，锌层上的有机涂层起了覆盖隔离作用 ，可防止钢板生锈，使用寿命比镀锌钢板更长，据介绍涂层钢板的使用寿命比镀锌钢板长50%。	In addition to zinc protection, the organic coating on the zinc coating can prevent the steel plate from rusting, and the service life is longer than that of the galvanized steel plate. It is introduced that the service life of the coated steel plate is 50% longer than that of the galvanized steel plate.
但是，在不同的地区和不同的使用部位，采用相同镀锌量、同种涂料、相同涂层厚度的彩色涂层板，其使 用寿命会有很大的不同。例如，在工业区或沿海地区，由于受到空气中二氧化硫气体或盐分的作用，腐蚀速度 加快，使用寿命受到影响。	However, in different areas and different parts of use, the use of the same coating, the same coating, the same coating thickness of color coating board, the service life will be very different. For example, in industrial or coastal areas, due to the role of sulfur dioxide gas or salt in the air, the corrosion rate is accelerated and the service life is affected.
市场上的彩涂板大多都是用于建筑行业，也有极少的一部分会用于其他行业，比如说航空领域、交通运输行业等等，这也就意味着彩涂板对于建筑行业的重要性，也可以说是不可替代了。不过，作为普通人的我们，可以不需要太了解关于彩涂板的知识，只需要知道彩涂板是什么，在彩涂板市场上有什么重要的用途就行了。	Most of the color coating board in the market is used in the construction industry, and a few parts will be used in other industries, such as the aviation industry, transportation and so on, which means that the color coating board is important to the construction industry, and it can be said to be irreplaceable. However, as the ordinary people, we do not need to know much about the color coating plate knowledge, only need to know what color coating is, what important use in the color coating market.
钢结构工程施工质量控制要点	Key points of construction quality control of steel structure engineering
随着现代经济的不断发展，钢结构工程以其施工速度快、周期短、强度高、便于预制、安装、适用高层大跨度等的优越性已在工程领域广泛应用。而过去，我国大量采用钢筋混凝土结构和预应力混凝土结构，现场工程技术人员比较缺乏钢结构工程的施工经验，施工质量的好坏直接影响工程结构的安全。因而，钢结构工程的质量问题也越来越引起人们的重视，因此加强钢结构工程施工质量控制，具有很重要的现实意义和必要性。	With the continuous development of modern economy, steel structure engineering has been widely used in engineering field for its advantages of fast construction, short period, high strength, easy to prefabricate, install, and apply high rise and large span. In the past, a large number of reinforced concrete structures and prestressed concrete structures were used in our country. The field engineering technicians lack the construction experience of steel structure engineering. The quality of construction directly affects the safety of the engineering structure. Therefore, the quality of the steel structure engineering has been paid more and more attention. Therefore, it is of great practical significance and necessity to strengthen the quality control of the construction of the steel structure.
施工质量控制要点	Key points of construction quality control
1	One
施工准备	Construction preparation
施工准备是建设施工创造必须条件，认真、细致、深入地做好施工准备工作，对充分发挥人的积极因素，合理组织人力、物力，加快工程进度，提供施工质量，节约投资和材料，对顺利完成钢结构建设任务起着重要的作用。	Construction preparation is a necessary condition for construction and construction. It is serious, meticulous and thorough to do a good job of construction preparation. It plays an important role in the successful completion of the construction of steel structure by giving full play to the positive factors of human beings, organizing the manpower and material resources reasonably, speeding up the project progress, providing the quality of construction, saving the investment and materials.
1.1认真做好施工图纸的会审和交底工作	1.1 Conferencing and submitting construction drawings
图纸是工程施工的依据，工程项目技术负责人应组织有关技术人员对图纸进行分工审阅和消化，其目的一是使施工单位和各参建单位熟悉设计图纸，了解工程特点和设计意图，找出需要解决的技术难题，并制定解决方案；二是为了解决图纸中存在的问题，减少图纸的差错，将图纸中的质量隐患消灭在萌芽之中。同时做好技术交底，做好施工和设计的结合、做好钢结构吊装与土建施工、钢结构和混凝土构预制的结合。	The drawings are the basis for the construction of the project. The technical officer of the engineering project should organize the technical personnel to examine and digest the drawings. The purpose of the drawings is to make the construction units and all the construction units familiar with the design drawings, to understand the engineering characteristics and the design intentions, to find out the technical problems to be solved and to formulate the solutions; two, In order to solve the problems in the drawings, reduce the errors in the drawings, eliminate the hidden dangers in the drawings. At the same time, we should make good technical disclosure, do well the combination of construction and design, do well in the combination of steel structure hoisting and civil construction, steel structure and precast concrete structure.
1.2认真编制钢结构工程施工组织设计	1.2 carefully compile the construction organization design of steel structure engineering
施工组织设计是施工单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，是一个科学的管理方法。施工单位在编制施工组织和施工方案时，须从人、机、料、法、环五个方面制定切实可行的具体实施细则，落实计划，落实组织人员，落实自检、互检和专检，把容易出现的质量问题全部纳入受控状态，确保方案技术措施得力、可行。在编制和贯彻施工组织设计过程中应做到广泛深入的研究，向施工人员交底，做到人人把关。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计。其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施。钢结构安装工程施工组织设计内容有质量保证体系和技术管理体系的建立、质量、进度控制的措施和方法、施工工期的安排等。	The construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document directed by the construction unit to guide the activities in the whole construction process, and is a scientific management method. In the preparation of construction organization and construction plan, the construction unit must formulate practical and concrete implementation rules from five aspects: human, machine, material, law and ring, implement the plan, implement the organization personnel, implement self inspection, mutual inspection and special inspection, and bring all the quality problems that are easy to be brought into the controlled state, and ensure that the technical and technical measures of the program are right. It is feasible. In the process of compiling and carrying out the construction organization design, extensive and thorough research should be done, and the bottom line should be laid down to the construction staff. For steel structure engineering, the manufacturing process and installation construction organization design should be worked out for the production stage and the installation stage respectively. The production process should include the working procedure of the production stage, the quality standard of each sub item, the technical requirement, and the specific measures to ensure the quality of the product. The construction organization and design of the steel structure installation project include the establishment of quality assurance system and technology management system, the measures and methods for quality and progress control, and the arrangement of construction period.

重视钢结构基础工程的质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of steel structure foundation engineering
钢结构基础工程的质量控制一般指钢结构基础预埋螺栓的质量控制，预埋螺栓是整个工程施工的第一步，也是非常关键的一步，是整个工程的基础。施工基础预埋螺栓时首先熟悉图纸，了解图纸的意图，应制作安装模板。预埋螺栓用两安装模板及钢筋定位在柱子的主筋和模板上，保证预埋螺栓不受土建浇注混凝土施工而移位。这样每组螺栓之间的间距、高低可控制在允许的误差范围内；同时，保护好螺栓丝扣，在混凝土浇筑时不被损坏。土建工程完工后，用经纬仪和水准仪对地脚螺栓的标高、轴线进行复查，并做好记录。并交下一道工序验收。	The quality control of the foundation engineering of steel structure generally refers to the quality control of the pre buried bolt of the steel structure. The pre buried bolt is the first step of the whole construction and a very critical step, and it is the foundation of the whole project. When the foundation bolts are embedded in the construction foundation, the drawings should be familiar with the intention of the drawings first, and the installation template should be made. The embedded bolts are positioned on the main reinforcement and the formwork of the column with two installation formwork and reinforcing bars to ensure that the embedded bolts are not moved by the construction of the pouring concrete. In this way, the spacing and height between the bolts of each group can be controlled within the allowable error range. At the same time, the bolt threads can not be damaged when the concrete is poured. After completion of the civil engineering, the elevation and axis of the anchor bolts should be reviewed with theodolite and level. And submit a procedure for acceptance.

钢结构制作工程质量控制	Quality control of steel construction engineering
钢结构工程的施工通常要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段。钢结构工程有大部分时间是在工厂车间内部进行，由于钢结构构件在工厂内加工制造的质量好坏，对钢结构工程的现场安装及整体结构的安全稳定至关重要。因此钢结构制作生产厂家必须具备相应企业资质、生产规模、技术能力、机械设备及先进的工艺水平。	The construction of steel structure usually has two stages: Factory fabrication and site installation. The steel structure works most of the time in the factory workshop, because the quality of the steel structure components manufacturing in the factory is very important to the site installation and the safety and stability of the overall structure of the steel structure engineering. Therefore, manufacturers of steel structure must have corresponding qualification, production scale, technical capability, mechanical equipment and advanced technological level.
钢结构一般制作工艺流程分为:放样→下料→拼板→切割→组立→埋弧焊接→钻孔→组装→矫正成型→铆工零配件下料→制作组装→焊接和焊接检验→防锈处理、涂装、编号→构件验收出厂。在钢结构制作中，应根据钢结构制作工艺流程，抓住关键工序进行质量控制，如控制关键零件的加工，主要构件的工艺、措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	The general production process of steel structure is divided into three parts: layout, blanking, cutting board, cutting, assembling, submerged arc welding, drilling, assembling, correction forming, riveting and assembling, making and assembling, welding and welding inspection, rust prevention treatment, painting, numbering and acceptance of the factory. In the production of steel structure, the process flow should be made according to the steel structure, and the quality control is carried out by the key process, such as the processing of the key parts, the process and measures of the main components, the processing equipment and the process equipment.

重视焊接工程质量控制	Attach importance to quality control of welding engineering
在钢结构制作和安装工程工程中焊接工程是最重要的环节，必须重视焊接工程质量控制。目前，钢结构在生产过程中大部分采用具自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，个别部位采用手工施焊。	Welding engineering is the most important part in the fabrication and installation of steel structures, and the quality control of welding engineering must be emphasized. At present, most of the steel structures are equipped with automatic submerged arc welding machines, partly equipped with semi automatic gas shielded welding machines, and some parts are manually welded.
焊接质量问题较多存在于手工焊缝，这些问题有：焊瘤、夹渣、气孔、没焊透、咬边、错边、焊缝尺寸偏差大、不用引弧板、焊接变形不矫正、飞溅物清理不净等。鉴于这种情况，钢结构施焊前，对焊条的合格证要进行检查，按说明书要求使用，焊工必须持证上岗证，焊缝表面不得有裂纹	There are many problems of welding quality in hand weld, such as welding, slag, gas hole, no penetration, bite, wrong side, large deviation of weld size, no arc plate, no correction of welding deformation and clean spatter. In view of this situation, before the steel structure is welded, the qualification certificate for the welding rod should be checked, and the welder must be certificated with the certificate, and there shall be no cracks on the surface of the weld.
工业厂房、仓库	Industrial buildings and warehouses
彩钢夹芯板主要应用于工业厂房、仓库的屋面和外墙。过去的工业厂房屋面多采用预制混凝土板或石棉板。随着轻钢结构的迅速推广，夹芯板也以其多项显著的优势取代了上述2种材料。	Color steel sandwich panels are mainly used in industrial buildings, roofs and external walls of warehouses. In the past, prefabricated concrete boards or asbestos boards were used in the roofs of industrial buildings. With the rapid expansion of the light steel structure, the 2 kinds of materials have been replaced by the sandwich panels with a number of significant advantages.
在提供更好隔热效果的同时，夹芯板配合已成熟发展的轻钢结构，能够真正体现轻钢体系轻质、快速高效、布置灵活等一系列优势，因而在目前的单层厂房建筑中已成为首选的方案。	While providing better insulation effect, sandwich panels, combined with the developed lightweight steel structure, can truly represent a series of advantages such as lightweight, fast and efficient layout and flexible layout of light steel system, so it has become the first choice in the current single story factory building.
而对于多层工业厂房，除了顶屋的屋面可采用夹芯板外，外墙也可利用夹芯板作灵活的布置，通过彩涂板多变的色彩和形状达到美化建筑外观的目的。对于恒温恒湿要求的工业建筑，采用热工性能优于砖墙的夹芯板作为围护材料，可大大节约建成后的运营成本。	For multi-storey industrial buildings, besides the roof, the roof can be made of sandwich panels. The outer wall can also be flexibly arranged by sandwich panels, and the purpose of beautifying the architectural appearance can be achieved by changing the color and shape of the color coated boards. For the industrial buildings with constant temperature and humidity requirements, the sandwich panels with the thermal performance superior to the brick wall are used as enclosure materials, which can greatly save the operation cost after the completion of the construction.
公共建筑	Public buildings
彩钢夹芯板主要可应用于有大空间需要的公共建筑的屋面和外墙中，如：机制、车站的候机或候车大厅，体育场馆、影剧院和礼堂、展览馆和会展中心、博物馆，等等。	The color steel sandwich panels can be mainly applied to the roofs and exterior walls of public buildings with large space requirements, such as mechanism, station waiting or waiting hall, stadiums, theaters and auditorium, exhibition centers and exhibition centers, museums and so on.
公共建筑由于具有需提供更大的空间、有室内空调、防火等一系列比工业厂房更高要求的特点，目前此类建筑多采用网架或管桁架的屋架结构形式，因此对屋面板的材料在轻质、保温和隔热、防火安全、防水、吸声、耐久性等方面都提出了更高的要求。	Because of the public buildings need to provide more space, indoor air conditioning, fire and a series of industrial buildings than the higher requirements of the characteristics of roof structure the building adopts the grid or pipe truss, the roofing material in light weight, heat preservation and heat insulation, fire prevention, waterproof, sound absorption, durability and safety other aspects are put forward higher requirements.
如何避开彩钢屋顶漏水？	How to avoid the leakage of the color steel roof?
目前彩钢金属板被广泛应用于家庭自搭结构顶板，如自封飘窗顶、自搭房屋面。	At present, the color steel plate is widely used in the family roof structure, such as self sealing ceiling and self building.
在北方与彩钢板搭接的房屋原有立墙结构往往存在保温构造层，而后搭设的金属板材与墙体多数只是对接，未对结构墙面进行任何开槽固定等处理，在后期使用中因受风雨侵蚀、温度变化及使用年限影响，搭接部位密封不严实等很容易造成渗漏问题。	The structure of the original vertical wall structure of the building in the north and the colored steel plate often exists the thermal insulation layer, and the metal plate and the wall are only butted, and the structure wall is not fixed. In the later use, the lap parts are sealed because of the influence of the wind and rain erosion, the temperature change and the service life. It is easy to cause leakage.
涂刷沥青维修	Repair of bitumen
为避免渗漏问题发生或者渗漏后进行维修治理的方法各有不同，各出奇招，打发泡胶密封、涂刷沥青材料、卷材覆盖等等，但其防水治理效果也不尽相同，有些方法可能只是解一时之需，无法达到长期治理、补漏的效果。	In order to avoid leakage or leakage, the methods of maintenance and treatment are different. They are different, they send out the bubble gum seal, the bitumen material, the roll cover and so on. But the effect of waterproof treatment is not the same, some methods may only solve the temporary needs, and can not reach the effect of long-term treatment and leakage.
卷材覆盖维修	Cover maintenance
由于搭设的彩钢板多为彩钢夹芯板，即两层成型金属面板和中间发泡、熟化成型的泡沫、岩棉或其他隔热内芯组成。为有效密封搭接缝并防止雨水从板材缝隙向下部保温层串水，需对渗漏的彩钢板整体进行防水防护处理。	The color steel plate is mostly made of color steel sandwich panels, which is composed of two layers forming metal panels and intermediate foams, cured foams, rock wool or other heat insulation inner cores. In order to effectively seal the joints and prevent rainwater from the seam to the lower insulation layer, it is necessary to protect the leaked color steel sheet as a whole.

Finally, the high projectile waterproof coating on the roof of the grid cloth is painted on the upper part of the grid cloth, and the mesh cloth is completely covered.

大面涂刷防水涂料	Waterproofing coating with large surface brush
彩钢板整体涂刷防水涂刷屋面高弹，厚度达到1.5mm，要求薄涂多遍，每遍防水涂膜完全干燥后在进行下一遍涂膜施工。	The waterproof coating of the color steel plate is highly projectile with a thickness of 1.5mm, which requires a thin coating of thin coating, and the coating is carried out for the next time after the waterproof coating is completely dried.

单层厂房钢结构一般是由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架、柱、吊车梁、制动梁（或桁架）、各种支撑以及墙架等构件组成的空间刚性骨架	Steel structure workshop is generally composed of purlin, roof rack, roof, bracket, column, crane beam, brake beam (or truss), space rigid frame and various supporting wall frame components
这些构件按其作用，可归并成下列体系：	These components can be incorporated into the following systems according to their functions:
(1) 横向平面框架——是厂房的基本承重结构，由柱和横梁（屋架）组成。承受作用在厂房的横向水平荷载和竖向荷载并传递到基础。	(1) the horizontal plane frame, the basic load-bearing structure of the plant, is composed of columns and beams (roof frames). The lateral horizontal load and vertical load of the plant are transmitted to the foundation.
(2) 纵向平面框架——由柱、托架、吊车梁及柱间支撑等构成。其作用是保证厂房骨架的纵向不可变形和刚度，承受纵向水平荷载（吊车的纵向制动力、纵向风力等）并传递到基础。	(2) longitudinal plane frame is composed of columns, brackets, columns between crane beam support. Its function is to ensure the vertical deformation and stiffness of the workshop skeleton, and to bear the longitudinal horizontal load (the longitudinal braking force and longitudinal wind force) of the crane, and transmit it to the foundation.
(3) 屋盖系统——由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架及屋盖支撑等构成。	(3) - roof system composed of purlin, roof rack, roof and roof support bracket, etc..
(4) 吊车梁及制动梁——主要承受吊车的竖向荷载和水平荷载，并传递到横向框架和纵向框架。	(4) the crane beam and the brake beam, which mainly bear the vertical load and horizontal load of the crane, are transferred to the transverse frame and the longitudinal frame.
(5) 支撑——包括屋盖支撑、柱间支撑及其它附加支撑。其作用是将单独的平面框架连成空间体系，以保证结构具有必要的刚度和稳定性，同时也有承受风力及吊车制动力的作用。	(5) support, including roof support, inter column support and other additional support. Its function is to connect a separate plane frame into a space system, so as to ensure that the structure has the necessary stiffness and stability, and also has the function of bearing the power of wind and crane.
(6) 墙架——承受墙体的重量和风力。	(6) a wall frame - bearing the weight of the wall and the wind.
此外，还有一些次要的构件如工作平台、梯子、门窗等。	In addition, there are some minor components, such as work platforms, ladders, doors and windows, etc.
各种构件的用钢量占整个厂房钢结构的总用钢量的比值大致如表所示。	The ratio of steel amount to the total amount of steel used for the entire steel structure of the whole plant is roughly as shown in the table.
厂房按单位面积计算的用钢量，是评定设计的经济合理性的一项重要指标。各类厂房单位面积用钢量的统计数值见下表	The amount of steel used in the workshop by unit area is an important index for evaluating the economic rationality of the design. The statistical value of the amount of steel used in the unit area of all kinds of workshops is shown in the following table
柱的类型	Type of column
柱按结构形式可分为：等截面柱和阶形柱。	The column can be divided into the same section column and the order column according to the structure form.
柱按柱的截面形式分为：实腹式柱和格构式柱。	The column is divided into the concrete column and the lattice column according to the cross section of the column.
柱脚按结构内力的边界条件划分，可分为铰接柱脚和刚性固定柱脚两大类。铰接柱脚仅传递竖向荷载和水平荷载，刚性固定柱脚除传递竖向和水平荷载外，还传递弯矩。刚性固定柱脚就其构造形式可分为三种形式：露出式柱脚、埋入式或插入式柱脚、外包式柱脚。按柱脚的结构形式则可分为整体式柱脚和分离式柱脚。	The column divided by boundary conditions of the internal force of the structure, can be divided into rigid fixed hinged column and column two categories. The hinged column transfer only vertical load and horizontal load, rigid fixed base in addition to transfer of vertical and horizontal loads, but also transfer moment. The structural form of rigid fixed base can be divided into three forms: a type of embedded column, or insert column, column foot. According to the structure of the form of the column can be divided into integral column and separated column.
钢柱的安装方法一般采用三种方法，即采用钢垫板方案、座浆垫板方案和调平螺帽与调平钢板方案。	Three methods are generally used for the installation of steel columns, that is, the steel cushion plate, the slurry cushion and the flat plate and the leveling steel plate.
构件工地拼装	Component site assembly
构件拼装是将若干个分段构件或单件，按设计要求在地面装配成完整的构件或构件组合体。	Component assembly is to assemble a number of piecewise components or single pieces to be assembled into complete components or component combinations on the ground according to the design requirements.
(1) 单一构件拼装	(1) single component assembly
1). 钢柱拼装	1). Steel column assembly
大型钢柱一般在变截面处或肩梁上部分段，进行分段运输。工地拼装后，用焊接或高强度螺栓连接，组成整根柱子进行吊装。	Large steel columns are generally segmented at the variable section or on the upper part of the shoulder beam for subsection transportation. After the construction site is assembled, the whole root column is hoisted with welded or high strength bolts.
首先在一条轴线上设置拼装台架，将钢柱下段吊放到台架上，垫平并确定中心线，再将柱的上段吊放到连接处，使两节柱插接端对准，拼接到位，仔细校准柱的中心轴线和长度尺寸等后，即可按图纸要求进行焊接或高强度螺栓连接固定。	First set the assembling bench at an axis on the steel column under section dipping to bench pad and determine the center line, then the upper column dipping into joints, the two column inserted end alignment, stitching in place, carefully calibrated column size and the length of the central axis, can according to the requirements of the drawings welding or high strength bolt connection fixation.
2). 钢屋架及天窗架拼装	2). Assembly of steel roof truss and skylight frame
一般采用平拼法，即将分块构件平卧于拼装平台上拼装。在起重机性能允许的条件下还可以将天窗架与屋架构件拼装成一体。拼装钢桁架时，要严格控制跨度误差和扭曲，使其不超出允许值。在翻转桁架时，为了防止变形，应确定合理的吊点，必要时还要进行临时加固。	Generally, the flat method is used, which is about to lie on the assembly platform. In the crane performance under permissible conditions can also be integrated with the roof member day window frame assembly. When the steel truss is assembled, the span error and distortion should be strictly controlled so that it does not exceed the allowable value. In order to prevent the deformation of the truss, a reasonable lifting point should be determined and temporary reinforcement should be carried out when necessary.
对于有天窗的大跨度屋架或高度较大的桁架，应用立拼法拼装，因为这种桁架的翻转是非常困难的。	For a large span roof truss with a skylight or a high height truss, a spelling spelling is applied, because the flipping of this truss is very difficult.
(1) 构件组合拼装	(1) component assembly and assembly
当具备大型起重机械，且按照条件允许时，可将诸多构件在地面拼装成一个稳定单元块体，进行整体吊装。这样可减少高空作业，有利于安全施工和提高工作效率，保证构件吊装的稳定性。例如两榀屋架与斜撑组合拼装、斜桥构架及通廊桁架组合拼装等。	When a large lifting machine is available and the conditions permit, a number of components can be assembled into a stable unit block on the ground to be hoisted as a whole. In this way, the operation of high altitude can be reduced, the safety construction and the efficiency of work can be improved, and the stability of the hoisting of the components is ensured. For example, two pieces of roof and brace assembly, bridge frame and truss corridor assembly etc..
构件组合拼装在安装现场进行，拼装位置必须在安装起重机的作用范围内。拼装的项目和规模必须根据起重机的性能、构件的强度、刚度、稳定性及施工环境等因素确定。	The component assembly is assembled at the installation site, and the assembly position must be within the scope of the installation of the crane. The project and scale of the assembly must be determined according to the performance of the crane, the strength of the component, the stiffness, the stability and the construction environment.

【干货】彩钢屋顶安装光伏发电站，重点注意事项	[dry goods] installation of photovoltaic power stations on color steel roofs, key points for attention
目前彩钢屋面多为坡屋面，常见的坡度为10%和5%。屋面板为压型钢板或压型夹芯板，下部为檩条，檩条搭设在门式刚架等主要支撑结构上。在国内，此种类型的屋面安装光伏电站实例较多。	At present, the color steel roofs are mostly sloping roofs, and the common slopes are 10% and 5%. The roof panels are profiled steel sheets or compression type sandwich panels, with purlin under the purlin and other main supporting structures such as portal frames. In China, there are many examples of photovoltaic power plants installed on such roofs.
对于此种屋面，光伏组件可沿屋面坡度平行铺设，也可以设计成一定倾角的方式布置。上部支架可通过不同的连接件、紧固件与屋面承重结构连接。常见的彩钢板屋面的主要形式有：直立锁边型、角驰型、卡口型、明钉型等。	For such roofs, photovoltaic modules can be laid parallel to the roof slope, or can be designed in a certain way. The upper bracket can be connected with the roof bearing structure through different connectors and fasteners. The main forms of the common color steel roof are vertical erection, corner type, clip type, and nail type.
屋面光伏发电项目属于对已有建筑物彩钢屋面的改造项目，因而建筑物的屋面形式、建筑物的结构形式、光伏阵列的布置形式及光伏组件本身的形式，以上条件的多样性决定了屋面光伏支架的形式多种多样。	The roofing photovoltaic power generation project belongs to the reconstruction project of the existing building color steel roof, so the roof form of the building, the structure of the building, the layout of the photovoltaic array and the form of the photovoltaic component itself, the diversity of the above conditions determines the variety of the shape of the roofing photovoltaic scaffold.
彩钢屋面的形式及建筑物的结构形式对光伏支架的工程造价影响较大。一般来说，屋面的防水等级越高，屋面防水层不外露，屋面的活荷载越大及建筑物整体结构较好、承载能力较强的屋面，光伏支架的工程造价越低，反之，工程造价越高。	The form of the color steel roof and the structural form of the building have great influence on the engineering cost of the PV bracket. In general, the higher the waterproof grade of the roof, the waterproof layer of the roof is not exposed, the greater the living load of the roof and the better overall structure of the building and the strong bearing capacity of the roof, the lower the cost of the photovoltaic scaffold, the higher the cost of the project.
彩钢瓦屋面电站设计方案中有几个重要的注意事项：	There are several important points in the design of color steel tile roofing power station.
1、明确光伏组件的形式及铺设方式，清楚原有建筑物的屋面形式。	1, clear the form and laying mode of PV modules, and clearly understand the roof form of the original buildings.
2、清楚原有建筑物的结构形式并对主要结构受力构件进行核算。	2. Clear the structural form of the original building and calculate the main structural components.
3、根据原有建筑物的屋面形式、结构形式、光伏阵列的布置形式、光伏组件本身的形式、结构核算结果及可能的施工措施等多项条件，给出各种可行的支架布置方案，确定最优的布置方式。	3. According to the roof form, the structure form, the layout of the photovoltaic array, the form of the photovoltaic array, the results of the structure accounting and the possible construction measures, various feasible arrangement schemes are given to determine the optimal layout.
4、屋面光伏项目有其施工上的特殊性，综合考虑现场施工条件，选择合适的施工工艺，并给出施工中的注意事项、施工保护剂安全施工措施等。	4, the roofing photovoltaic project has its particularity in construction, considering the site construction conditions, choosing the appropriate construction technology, and giving the notice in the construction, the safety construction measures of the construction protection agent and so on.
工程施工中遇到的问题和改进的建议及措施：	Problems encountered in engineering construction and suggestions and measures for improvement:
一、采用最佳的支撑方案和倾角方案，来解决积水、积尘和高温带来的影响。	First, adopt the best supporting scheme and inclination plan to solve the influence of water accumulation, dust accumulation and high temperature.
在建设分布式电站时，可以利用屋顶彩钢瓦坡度来进行评估。彩钢瓦基本与工业相关，彩钢瓦在夏天的时候温度很高，高温对发电效率会有一些影响。	When building a distributed power station, we can make use of the rooftop color steel tile slope to evaluate. The color steel tile is basically related to industry. The color steel tile is very high in summer, and the high temperature will have some influence on the efficiency of electricity generation.
二、光伏组件采用横向排列，减少阴影面积，提高有效利用面积，从而增加发电效率。	Two. PV modules are arranged horizontally to reduce the shadow area and improve the effective utilization area, thereby increasing the efficiency of power generation.
三、夏季时，彩钢瓦经暴晒后温度非常高，加之工业厂房本身的室内温度比较高，这样对组件的发电效率十分有影响。在彩钢瓦上增设喷洒装置，既利于电站的降温，又利于瓦面的降温。	In three, in summer, the temperature of the color steel tiles is very high after exposure to the sun, and the indoor temperature of the industrial plant itself is high, which has a great influence on the power generation efficiency of the components. Adding spray device on the color steel tile is beneficial to the cooling of the power station and the cooling of the tile surface.
四、设计合理的组串走线，降低线缆长度与线损。	Four, design a reasonable string to reduce cable length and line loss.
五、使用组串式逆变器，提高弱光利用率，逆变器低电压启动，综合利用时数提高。	Five, the use of series inverter to improve the utilization of low light, inverter low voltage start, comprehensive utilization of time increased.
工业厂房、仓库	Industrial buildings and warehouses
彩钢夹芯板主要应用于工业厂房、仓库的屋面和外墙。过去的工业厂房屋面多采用预制混凝土板或石棉板。随着轻钢结构的迅速推广，夹芯板也以其多项显著的优势取代了上述2种材料。	Color steel sandwich panels are mainly used in industrial buildings, roofs and external walls of warehouses. In the past, prefabricated concrete boards or asbestos boards were used in the roofs of industrial buildings. With the rapid expansion of the light steel structure, the 2 kinds of materials have been replaced by the sandwich panels with a number of significant advantages.
在提供更好隔热效果的同时，夹芯板配合已成熟发展的轻钢结构，能够真正体现轻钢体系轻质、快速高效、布置灵活等一系列优势，因而在目前的单层厂房建筑中已成为首选的方案。	While providing better insulation effect, sandwich panels, combined with the developed lightweight steel structure, can truly represent a series of advantages such as lightweight, fast and efficient layout and flexible layout of light steel system, so it has become the first choice in the current single story factory building.
而对于多层工业厂房，除了顶屋的屋面可采用夹芯板外，外墙也可利用夹芯板作灵活的布置，通过彩涂板多变的色彩和形状达到美化建筑外观的目的。对于恒温恒湿要求的工业建筑，采用热工性能优于砖墙的夹芯板作为围护材料，可大大节约建成后的运营成本。	For multi-storey industrial buildings, besides the roof, the roof can be made of sandwich panels. The outer wall can also be flexibly arranged by sandwich panels, and the purpose of beautifying the architectural appearance can be achieved by changing the color and shape of the color coated boards. For the industrial buildings with constant temperature and humidity requirements, the sandwich panels with the thermal performance superior to the brick wall are used as enclosure materials, which can greatly save the operation cost after the completion of the construction.
公共建筑	Public buildings
彩钢夹芯板主要可应用于有大空间需要的公共建筑的屋面和外墙中，如：机制、车站的候机或候车大厅，体育场馆、影剧院和礼堂、展览馆和会展中心、博物馆，等等。	The color steel sandwich panels can be mainly applied to the roofs and exterior walls of public buildings with large space requirements, such as mechanism, station waiting or waiting hall, stadiums, theaters and auditorium, exhibition centers and exhibition centers, museums and so on.
公共建筑由于具有需提供更大的空间、有室内空调、防火等一系列比工业厂房更高要求的特点，目前此类建筑多采用网架或管桁架的屋架结构形式，因此对屋面板的材料在轻质、保温和隔热、防火安全、防水、吸声、耐久性等方面都提出了更高的要求。	Because of the public buildings need to provide more space, indoor air conditioning, fire and a series of industrial buildings than the higher requirements of the characteristics of roof structure the building adopts the grid or pipe truss, the roofing material in light weight, heat preservation and heat insulation, fire prevention, waterproof, sound absorption, durability and safety other aspects are put forward higher requirements.
钢结构工程的施工	Construction of steel structure engineering
1、要切实作好钢结构制作及安装单位的考察与选择工作	1. The investigation and selection of the production and installation units of the steel structure should be conscientiously done.
我们知道，钢结构工程的施工要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，这两个阶段可由一个施工单位完成，但有时也可能由两个单位分别完成（分包）。切实作好钢结构制作单位和安装单位的考察与选择工作，对于确保钢结构工程质量及进度，具有重要意义。钢结构制作、安装单位的考察内容主要有：企业资质，生产规模，技术人员数量、职称及履历，技术工人数量及资格证，机械设备情况，以及业绩情况等级。点这免费下载施工技术资料	As we know, the construction of steel structure has to go through two stages: Factory fabrication and on-site installation. These two stages can be completed by a construction unit, but sometimes it can be completed by two units separately. It is of great significance to ensure the quality and progress of the steel structure engineering by making a good work on the inspection and selection of the production units and installation units of steel structures. The research contents of the production and installation of steel structure mainly include: enterprise qualification, production scale, number of technical personnel, professional title and resume, number of technical workers, qualification certificates, machinery and equipment, and performance level. Point this free downloading of construction technical data
2、严格审查承包单位提交的钢结构制作工艺及安装施工组织设计	2. Strictly examine the design of the steel construction technology and the installation and construction organization submitted by the contractor
施工组织设计是承包单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，认真审查施工组织设计是监理工作事前控制和主动控制的重要内容。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计，其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施，如关键零件的加工方法，主要构件的工艺流程、工艺措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document guiding the Contractor's activities in the whole construction process. The careful review of construction organization design is an important part of pre control and active control in supervision work. Steel structure engineering for production and installation stage respectively in the preparation of construction organization design and installation of production process, the production process includes the production stage of each process and each sub quality standards, technical requirements, and to ensure the quality of products and to develop the specific measures, such as the key parts of the processing method, technological process, main component the process measures, processing equipment, the process equipment etc..
3、要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作	3, we should pay full attention to the supervision work in the production stage
如前所述，钢结构工程均要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，而制作和安装一般是由钢结构工程公司下属的两个基层单位（制作车间和安装项目部）分别负责，有时还可能由制造厂和安装公司两个单位分别完成（分包）。监理工程师要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作，要象其他类型工程的监理工作一样，切实搞好事前控制和事中控制，对各工序、各分项都要做到检查认真而及时、严格而到位。要避免那种放松工厂制作过程的监理，仅靠构件完成后进场验收的错误工作方法。这一点在制作单位距工程所在地路程较远的情况下，尤其要注意。	As mentioned earlier, the steel structure engineering must pass through factory production and installation of two stages, and the production and installation is two units under the steel structure engineering company (production workshop and installation project department) are responsible for, and sometimes were completed by the factory and the company installed two units (including package). The supervision engineer should pay enough attention to the supervision work in the production stage, like the supervision work of other types of projects, do well the control before and in the middle affairs, and check every process and sub item strictly, timely and strictly. It is necessary to avoid the supervision of the process of relaxing factory production, and the wrong method of working for the post acceptance check only by the component. This point should be paid attention to in the case that the production unit is far away from the site of the project.
4、安装阶段的监理	4, the supervision of the installation stage
钢结构安装阶段的监理工作内容主要是监督承包单位内部管理体系和质保体系的运行情况，督促落实施工组织设计的各项技术、组织措施，严格按照国家现行钢结构有关规范、标准进行施工。钢结构安装阶段的监理工作应重点抓好以下几个环节：安装方案的合理性和落实情况、安装测量、高强度螺栓的连接、安装焊接质量、安装尺寸偏差的实测、涂装等。监理工作要加强现场巡视检查、平行检验和旁站监督，尤其是在目前部分钢结构施工单位素质偏低，施工仍欠规范的情况下，切实做好现场巡视和旁站，对于确保钢结构工程的施工质量，更有现实意义。	The supervision work of steel structure installation stage is the main operation of the supervision contractor internal management system and quality assurance system, supervise the implementation of the technology, organization design measures of construction, the construction in strict accordance with the current national norms and standards of steel structure. During the installation phase of steel structure, we should focus on the following aspects: the rationality and implementation of installation plan, installation and measurement, connection of high-strength bolts, installation and welding quality, installation size deviation measurement and painting. To strengthen the supervision of site inspection, site of parallel inspection and supervision, especially in the current unit part of steel structure construction quality is low, the construction is still owed norms, to do on-site inspection and supervision, to ensure the construction quality of steel structure engineering, more practical significance.
5、关于钢结构工程的试验检测工作	5. On testing and testing of steel structure engineering
钢结构工程的制作及安装施工的多项试验检测工作是一般土建工程所没有的，这些试验检测项目主要有：钢材原材有关项目的检测（必要时），焊接工艺评定试验（必要时），焊缝无损检测（超声波、X射线、磁粉等）、高强度螺栓扭矩系数或预拉力试验、高强度螺栓连接面抗滑移系数检测、钢网架节点承载力试验、钢结构防火涂料性能试验等。	Production and installation of the number of test work of steel structure engineering is the general civil engineering does not, these test items include: detection of steel raw material of the project (if necessary), welding procedure qualification test (if necessary), non destructive testing of weld (super sonic, X ray, magnetic powder, etc.) the strength of bolt torque coefficient or pre tension test, high strength bolt connection surface detection, anti slip coefficient of steel truss joint bearing capacity test and performance test of steel structure fire retardant coating.
作好这些试验、检测工作要注意以下几点：	The following points should be paid attention to in doing these tests and testing.
（1）要监督委托有相应资质的检测机构进行；	(1) to supervise the inspection agencies entrusted with corresponding qualifications;
（2）要坚持取样、送检的见证制度，要避免试件与工程不一致现象；	(2) we should adhere to the witness system of sampling and inspection, and avoid the inconsistency between the test pieces and the project.
（3）对于部分检测项目，具有相应资质的检测机构较少，路程较远，且费用较高，在这种情况下，监理工程师必须坚持原则，态度明确，立场坚定，及时督促承包单位落实这些工作，这是确保钢结构制作与安装质量及施工进度的必要措施，也是国家现行钢结构工程施工质量验收规范规定的“主控项目”。	(3) for some test items, with the corresponding qualification testing organization is less, the distance, and the cost is higher, in this case, the engineer must adhere to the principle of a clear attitude, stand firm, to urge the contractor to implement these work, it is necessary to ensure the measures of steel structure fabrication and installation quality and construction schedule the main control program, the current national regulations and steel structure construction quality acceptance "".
6、钢结构工程其它几个重要质量控制点	6. Some other important quality control points for steel structure engineering
6.1 地脚螺栓的预埋	The preembedding of 6.1 anchor bolts
地脚螺栓的预埋质量直接影响钢结构的安装质量，控制好地脚螺栓（群）的位置、垂直度、长度和标高，对于减少扩孔及调整工作量（甚至避免返工），提高结构安装质量具有重要意义。地脚螺栓的预埋方法可采用直接预埋法，也可采用预留孔法。基础砼浇筑前监理工程师必须严格检查预埋螺栓施工方法的合理性、可靠性，以及各项实测指标是否在规范规定范围内。点这免费下载施工技术资料	The embedment quality of anchor bolts directly affects the installation quality of steel structures. Controlling the location, perpendicularity, length and elevation of anchor bolts is of great significance for reducing reaming and adjusting workload, or even avoiding rework, and improving the quality of structure installation. The pre embedding method of the anchor bolts can be used directly, and the reserved hole method can be used. Before the foundation concrete is poured, the supervision engineer must strictly check the rationality and reliability of the construction method of the embedded bolts, and whether the measured indicators are within the prescribed limits.

6.2 焊接工程质量控制	6.2 quality control of welding engineering
焊接工程是钢结构制作和安装工程最重要的分项之一，监理工程师必须从事前准备，施焊过程和成品检验各个环节，切实作好焊接工程的质量控制工作。目前，我市钢结构施工单位绝大部分都具备自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，仅在个	Welding engineering is one of the most important sub items in the fabrication and installation works of steel structure. The supervision engineer must engage in the preparation, welding process and inspection of finished products, and do well the quality control work of welding engineering. At present, most of the construction units of steel structure in our city have automatic submerged arc welding machines, some of which have semi-automatic gas protection welding machines.
在当前经济的不断发展，造就了现今钢结构彩钢活动房行业的高速发展，由于房产的高速发展，也给目前的一个彩钢板活动房市场带来了无与伦比的活力，彩钢板活动房因其自身的耐腐蚀、耐老化、轻质耐用、隔热保温、使用寿命长等特点，使其具有广阔的使用市场。在我公司亦有诸多项目选择使用。	With the continuous development of the current economy, the high-speed development of the current steel structure color steel active room industry is made. Because of the rapid development of the real estate, it has also brought unparalleled vitality to the present market of color steel plate active room. The color steel plate active room has its own corrosion resistance, Nai Lao, light quality, heat insulation and use. Long life and so on, so that it has a wide use market. In our company, there are also a number of projects to be used.
主要原因是源于彩钢板活动房有着耐腐蚀、耐老化、使用寿命长的特点。由于这种房屋的主要建材是镀锌的彩钢板，因此本身具有较强的耐腐蚀特性，甚至直接的表面接触也无化学反应，这也使得这样的房屋十分耐用，其次.彩钢板活动房的消音.隔热方面性能尤其突出。由于彩钢板活动房的使用板材基本都是夹芯彩钢板，而夹芯彩钢板的特点就在于能够良好的隔音，且有着隔热保温的作用，因此这样的一个彩钢板活动房在多个方面的很是受到欢迎。	The main reason is that the color steel plate movable room has the characteristics of corrosion resistance, aging resistance and long service life. Because the main building materials of this building are galvanized colored steel plates, they have strong corrosion resistance and even direct surface contact without chemical reaction, which makes such a house very durable, followed by the silencing of the colored steel plate active room. Because the color steel plate active room is basically the sandwich plate, and the feature of the sandwich plate is that it can sound insulation well, and it has the function of heat insulation and heat preservation, so a color steel plate active room is very popular in many aspects.
但时值春季，空气干燥、温度回升、风沙天气频繁，因此要注意防风防火工作。	But in spring, the air is dry, the temperature rises and the wind and sand weather are frequent. Therefore, we should pay attention to the work of windbreak and fire prevention.
同时，由于活动房材料一般都质量比较轻，在没有固定前容易被风吹走，得注意固定堆放，减轻不必要的损失。施工时更应该注意固定好每一个锣丝，标准活动房的轻钢骨架一般都是经过严格设计好的，每一个锣丝都有它存在的必要性，施工员在施工时必须检查每个锣丝的是否固定好，不得偷工图快。	At the same time, because the materials of the mobile rooms are generally lighter in quality, they are easily blown away by wind before they are fixed. Attention should be paid to fixed stacking to reduce unnecessary losses. In the construction, we should pay more attention to fixing each gongs. The light steel skeleton of the standard room is generally designed strictly. Every Gong silk has its necessity. The constructors must check whether each Gong silk is fixed in the construction.
春季来临，出现不少活动房被风吹掉的现象，经查活动房本身质量都没问题，基本上都是外包给施工队施工时，施工员一味图施工快，没有严格按施工要求固定给造成的。	Spring is coming, a lot of active rooms are blown away by the wind, and the quality of the checking room itself is no problem. Basically, when the construction team is outsourced to the construction team, the constructors have a quick construction, and they are not strictly fixed to the construction requirements.
建议：	Suggestion:
1、彩钢板房如果是采用聚苯乙烯作夹芯板那么就要注意防火。比如：不在靠近墙体处进行电焊施工、冬季取暖炉灶应该加装防火装置、室内线路铺设时应该采用金属管，金属管应可靠接地或采用耐火材料管另外需要穿过墙壁时也应加套管进行防护、需要作防水处理的屋面严禁在该材料上使用喷灯！在空旷地带屋面瓦铁皮小于0.6毫米时房屋应该加装避雷针。	1, if the color steel board room is to use polystyrene as sandwich panel, we should pay attention to fire prevention. For example, the welding construction is not carried out near the wall, the winter heating stove should be equipped with fireproof device, and the metal pipe should be used when laying the indoor line. The metal pipe should be reliably grounded or the refractory pipe should be added when the wall is needed through the wall, and the roof of the waterproof treatment should be strictly prohibited on the material. Use the lamp! In the open area, the roof should be installed with lightning rods when the tile size is less than 0.6 mm.
2、彩钢板房应注意防风。彩钢板房重量轻结构简单抗风能力弱，为提高抗风能力请客户尽量选择正规厂家的板房，不要只顾价格便宜而留下后患。对已经安装了没有抗风能力的板房客户可以在屋顶上沿板房长度的方向在前、后墙体的上方用鉆尾丝固定4×4角钢等措施加以补救。	2, color steel plate room should pay attention to wind protection. Color steel plate room weight light structure simple resistance ability is weak, in order to improve the wind resistance ability, please try to choose the regular manufacturer of the house, not only the price is cheap and left behind. The customers who have been installed with no wind resistance can be remedied in the direction of the length of the plate room on the roof in the direction of the front and back wall with 4 x 4 angle steel fixed with the drill tail wire.
3、轻型钢结构房屋应注意檩条的型号不要太小，施工完毕后应验看各部分的连接加固情况，必要时可以采取各种安全防风措施，做好彩钢活动房屋的屋顶的安全防护工作，就能避免此类事件的再次发生。	3, light steel structure housing should pay attention to the type of purlin not too small. After the construction, it should be checked to see the connection and reinforcement of each part. If necessary, various safety precautions can be taken to do a good job of the safety protection of the roof of the color steel moving house, so that this kind of event can be avoided again.
集装箱活动房最主要的材料是做框架的槽钢和做墙体天花的夹芯板，这两样材料的质量好坏直接影响集装箱活动房质量的好坏。槽钢的差异主要表现在槽钢厚度的差别上，有的厂家消售的住人集装箱固然表面差异不大，但槽钢的厚度却有不同，做出来的住人集装箱承受度也不同。有的住人集装箱能够叠三层，可以承受更大的压力，而有的住人集装箱只能叠两层，承受不了叠三层带来的压力。	The main material of the container house is the channel steel of the frame and the sandwich board for the wall smallpox. The quality of the two materials will directly affect the quality of the container moving room. The difference of channel steel is mainly reflected in the difference of channel steel thickness. Although there is little difference in the surface, the thickness of channel steel is different, and the tolerance of the resident container is different. Some containers can be stacked three stories, can withstand greater pressure, and some people living containers can only stack two layers, can not withstand the pressure of three layers.
槽钢厚度不够，接受压力时容易弯曲，住人集装箱呈现变形，影响运用寿命。这种集装箱活动房短时间内看不出变化，但时间长了之后容易呈现变形、倒塌等问题，可能会危及集装箱活动房里面的人们的安全。因而，住人集装箱的槽钢选择有一定的规范，不能由于俭省本钱而是用低于规范的槽钢资料，这样很容易呈现问题。	The thickness of the channel steel is not enough, it is easy to bend when receiving pressure, and the deformation of container will affect the service life. This kind of container house can not change in a short time, but it is easy to take on the problems of deformation and collapse after a long time, which may jeopardize the safety of the people in the container house. Therefore, there is a certain standard for the selection of the channel steel for the resident container, and it is easy to use the channel steel data which is lower than the standard, so it is easy to present the problem.
关于白顶白箱和铁顶白箱类型的住人集装箱，彩钢夹芯板的好坏直接影响住人集装箱的运用寿命。目前市场市场上的彩钢夹芯板资料良莠不齐，有的用于集装箱活动房，有的用于活动板房，用在不同用处的彩钢夹芯板的钢板厚度差异很大。用于活动板房的彩钢夹芯板假如用在住人集装箱上面，几个月后彩钢夹芯板可能呈现钢板零落、生锈等一系列问题，住人集装箱呈现损坏。因而，住人集装箱一定要运用专用于住人集装箱的彩钢夹芯板，由河南千万间生产的新型聚氨酯保温夹芯板最适合应于集装箱房屋，不能由于要降低本钱而运用不契合规范的彩钢夹芯板，这样影响住人集装箱的运用寿命。	As for white containers with white top and iron top white boxes, the quality of color steel sandwich panels directly affects the service life of containers. At present, the material of color steel sandwich panels on the market market is very good and bad, some are used in container house, some are used in active room, and the thickness of steel plate with color steel sandwich panels in different uses is very different. If the color steel sandwich panel used in the active board room is used on the living container, the color steel sandwich panel may present a series of problems such as the steel plate and rusting after a few months, and the resident container is damaged. Therefore, the resident container must use the color steel sandwich panel which is specially designed for the human container. The new polyurethane thermal insulation sandwich panels produced by tens of millions in Henan are the most suitable for container houses.
一、啥叫彩钢？	First, what is called color steel?
彩色涂层钢板，俗称彩钢板，以冷轧钢板镀上其他金属非金属或合金（锌、铝、镁、锰、硅等）为基板，经过表面处理转化后（脱脂、磷化、铬酸盐），涂覆有机涂层经烘烤制成，具有轻质高强、色彩鲜艳、耐久性好等特点。广泛应用于建筑、家电、装潢、汽车等领域。	Color coated steel plate, commonly known as color steel plate, cold rolled steel plated to other metal non metal or alloy (aluminum, zinc, magnesium, manganese, silicon etc.) as substrate, after surface treatment after transformation (degreasing, phosphating, chromate), organic coatings made by baking, has the characteristics of high strength, bright color, durability good. Widely used in architecture, home appliances, decoration, automobiles and other fields.
彩钢板的强度取决于基板材料和厚度，耐久性取决于镀层、表面涂层和加工工艺，涂层有聚酯涂层（PE）、氟碳涂层（PVDF）、硅改性涂层（SMP）、高耐侯涂层（HDP）、丙稀酸涂层、聚氨脂涂层（PU）、塑料溶胶涂层（PVC）	Color steel plate strength depends on the substrate material and thickness, durability depends on the coating, surface coating and processing technology, coated with polyester coating (PE), fluorocarbon coating (PVDF), silicon modified coating (SMP), high corrosion resistance coating (HDP), acrylic acid, polyurethane coating, plastic coating (PU) sol coating (PVC)
等。涂层结构有二涂一烘、二涂二烘等，免维护使用年限根据环境大气不同可为10－30年。	Etc.. The coating structure has two coating, one baking, two coating and two baking, etc. the maintenance free service life can be 10-30 years depending on the ambient atmosphere.
涂层结构	Coating structure
上表面 下表面	The lower surface of the upper surface
一次涂层 不涂 1/0	One coat is not coated with 1/0
一次涂层 一次涂层 1/1	One coat once coating 1/1
二次涂层 不涂 2/0	The two coating is not coated with 2/0
二次涂层 一次涂层 2/1	Two coating one coat 2/1
二次涂层 二次涂层 2/2	Two coating two coat 2/2
二、常用涂料	Two, commonly used coatings
1、聚酯(PE、Polyester )	1, polyester (PE, Polyester)
PE涂料对于材质有良好的附着性，彩涂钢板易于加工成型，价廉且产品多，颜色和光泽的选择余地大。聚酯涂料对耐紫外光性与涂膜耐粉化性，并不理想，因此PE涂料的使用仍需受到一些限制，一般用在空气污染不严重的地区或需多次成型加工的产品。	PE coating has good adhesion to the material. Color coated steel sheet is easy to process, low price and many products, and the choice of color and luster is great. Polyester coatings are not ideal for UV resistance and film coating resistance, so the use of PE coatings still need some restrictions, generally used in areas where air pollution is not serious or need to be processed several times.
2、硅改性聚酯（SMP,Silicone Mobified Polyester)	2, silicon modified polyester (SMP, Silicone, Mobified, Polyester)
由于聚酯含有活性基-OH/-COOH，极易和其它高分子化和物反应，为改良PE的耐阳光性与粉化性，以色泽保持性与耐热性优的Silicone树脂作变性反应，和PE的变性比可于5%—50%之间，SMP提供钢板更好的持久性，其防蚀年限可长达10-12年，当然其价格也比较PE为高，但因Silicone树脂对材质的附着性和加工成型性并不理想，因此SMP彩涂钢板并不适用于需多次成型加工的场合，大部分用于建筑屋顶及外墙。	Because the polyester containing active base -OH/-COOH, easy and other polymer and reaction is improved PE resistance and pulverization of the sun, to maintain color and excellent heat resistance of Silicone resin modified reaction, and PE ratio from 5% to 50% between degeneration, persistent SMP plate provides better, the anti corrosion period can be up to 10-12 years, of course, the price is relatively high in PE, but due to material adhesion and molding of Silicone resin is not ideal, so SMP color coated steel plate is not suitable for multiple processing occasions, mostly used for building roof and exterior wall.
3、高耐侯聚酯(HDP、High durable Polyster)	3, high durability polyester (HDP, High durable Polyster)
对于PE和SMP的缺点，英国HYDRO公司（现被BASF收购）、瑞典的BECKER等在2000年初其开发出可达到PVDF涂层60-80%耐候性HDP聚酯涂料，且优于普通的硅改性聚酯涂料，其户外耐候性达到15年。高耐候聚酯树脂在合成时采用含环己烷结构的单体，来达到树脂的柔韧性、耐候性和成本的平衡，采用不含芳香族的多元醇和多元酸来减少树脂对UV光线的吸收，达到涂料的高耐候性能。涂料配方中加入紫外线吸收剂和位阻胺（HALS）提高漆膜耐候性能。高耐候聚酯卷材涂料在国外已被市场认可，该涂料性价比十分突出。	For the shortcomings of PE and SMP, the British HYDRO company (now acquired by BASF), Sweden's BECKER and so on, in the early 2000, it developed PVDF coating 60-80% weather resistant HDP polyester coating, and better than ordinary silicone modified polyester coating, its outdoor weathering resistance reached 15 years. High weather resistant polyester resin with monomer containing cyclohexane structure in synthesis, to achieve the flexibility of the resin, durability and cost balance, which did not contain aromatic polyols and polybasic acid to reduce the absorption of resin for UV light, high weatherability of coatings. Adding ultraviolet absorber and hindered amine (HALS) in coating formula to improve weatherability of paint film. High weather resistant polyester coil coating has been recognized in foreign markets, and its performance is very outstanding.
4、PVC 塑料溶胶（PVC Plastisol）	4, PVC sol (PVC Plastisol)
PVC树脂有很好的耐水性和耐化学药品性，一般以高固形份涂装，其涂装厚度于l00-300μm之间，能提供平滑的PVC涂膜或轻压花处理作压花涂膜;由于PVC涂膜为热可塑性树脂，具有高膜厚，能提供钢板良好的保护。但PVC耐热性较弱。在早期在欧洲使用较多，由于其环保属性相对较差，目前使用越来越少。	PVC resin has good water resistance and chemical resistance, with high solid content of coating, the coating thickness between l00-300 m, can provide a smooth PVC film or light embossing processing for embossing coating; PVC coating due for thermoplastic resin, with high film thickness, can provide protection for steel plate good. But the heat resistance of PVC is weak. It was used more frequently in Europe in the early stage, because of its relatively poor environmental protection properties, the current use of less and less.
5、PVDF	5, PVDF
由于PVDF的化学键与化学键间，有很强的键能，因此涂料具有非常好的防蚀性和色泽保持性，在建筑工业用彩涂钢板涂料中，是属于最高级产品，且分子量大又为直键型结构，因此除耐化学药品性之外，机械性能、耐紫外线和耐热性能也很突出。在一般环境下，其防蚀年限可达20—25年之久。近年来，国内开始盛行以三氟氯乙烯和乙烯酯单体共聚的含氟树脂，大量应用于建筑的外墙和金属板，由于使用易水解的乙烯酯单体和氟的含量较PVDF低30%左右，因此其耐候性与PVDF比较，有一定的差距。宝钢所生产的氟碳涂层，其涂层PVDF含量不小于70%（其他为丙稀酸树脂）。	Due to chemical bonding and chemical bonding between PVDF, there is a strong bond energy, so the coating has good corrosion resistance and color retention, in the construction industry with painted steel coatings, is among the most advanced products, and large molecular weight and straight bond type structure, so in addition to chemical resistance besides, the mechanical properties, UV resistance and heat resistance is also very prominent. In general environment, the corrosion prevention period can reach 20 - 25 years. In recent years, the country has become popular with fluorine resin containing fluorine three vinyl chloride and vinyl monomers, is widely used in the construction of the wall and the metal plate, the 30% low hydrolysis of vinyl ester monomer and the fluorine content is about PVDF, so the weather resistance compared with PVDF, there is a certain gap. Fluorocarbon coating produced by Baosteel, the content of PVDF is not less than 70% (the other is acrylic resin).
6、聚氨酯	6, polyurethane
近年所开发的一个面漆新品种，综合性能优异，价格昂贵，正在推广中。	A new top coat developed in recent years, which has excellent comprehensive performance and high price, is being popularized.
7、丙稀酸树脂	7, acrylic resin
综合性能好，价格昂贵，只在特定领域内使用（如集装箱用）。	Comprehensive performance is good, expensive, only in a specific field (such as container).
广泛运用到我们的生活中，主要原因还是在于彩涂板具有良好的防腐蚀性能，而且易于加工改造，比其他材质的板材都要轻，所以彩涂板才会在建筑市场上受到极大的重视。那么，彩涂板是什么以及彩涂板市场用途是什么呢?我们一起来看看吧。	Widely used in our life, the main reason is that the color coating plate has good corrosion resistance, and easy to process and transform, lighter than the other materials, so color coating plate will be paid great attention to in the building market. Then, what is the color coated board and the market application of the color coated plate? Let's have a look.
彩涂板市场用途	Market use of color coating board
彩涂板是一种新型的复合材料，有PCM和VCM两种。什么是复合材料呢?想必很多人多它都存在着疑问，复合材料就是由有机高分子、无机非金属或金属等几类不同材料通过复合工艺组合而成的新型材料。	Color coated sheet is a new type of composite material, which has two kinds of PCM and VCM. What is composite material? It is necessary for many people to doubt that the composite material is a new type of material composed of a combination of organic polymer, inorganic nonmetal or metal and other different materials.
彩涂板适用于多的领域，包括建筑、家电和交通运输三部分。在建筑领域，因为彩涂板涂层钢板具有轻质、美观和防腐蚀性能，所以它被广泛用于建造钢结构厂房、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶和墙面。在家电领域，彩涂板用于生产冰箱、微波炉等家电的表面。在交通运输方面，彩涂板被应用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等方面的生产，加工。	Color coated panels are applied to many fields, including building, household appliances and transportation three parts. In the field of architecture, color coated plate coated steel plates are lightweight, beautiful and anticorrosive, so it is widely used to build roofs and walls of industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, storeroom, freezers, and so on. In the field of household appliances, color coated boards are used to produce the surface of household appliances such as fridge and microwave oven. In transportation, color coated panels are applied to the production and processing of oil pan, automotive interior parts and so on.
彩涂板市场用途主要分为建筑、家电和交通运输等三部分，其中建筑领域所占比例大，家电业次之 ，交通运输业只占较少一部分。建筑用彩涂板一般以热镀锌钢板和热镀铝锌钢板为基板，主要加工成瓦楞板或 与聚氨酯符合夹芯板后，用于建造钢结构厂房、机场、库房、冷冻库等工业和商业建筑的屋顶、墙面、门。家 电彩板一般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，用于生产冰箱和大型空调系统，冰柜、面包机、家具等。交通运输业上一 般以电镀锌和冷板为基板，主要用于油底壳，汽车内饰件等。	The use of color coating board is mainly divided into three parts, such as construction, household appliances and transportation, among which the proportion of the construction field is large, the household appliance industry is the second, and the transportation industry is only a small part. The color coated plates are usually made of hot-dip galvanized steel plate and hot plated aluminum zinc plate, which are mainly processed into corrugated boards or polyurethane conforms to sandwich panels, and are used to build roofs, walls and doors for industrial and commercial buildings, such as steel structures, airports, storeroom, freezers and so on. Home appliance color boards are usually made of galvanized and cold plate as substrates. They are used for producing refrigerators and large air conditioning systems, freezers, bakery, furniture and so on. In transportation industry, zinc plating and cold plate are commonly used as substrates, which are mainly used for oil pan, automotive interior decorations, etc.
彩涂板彩涂卷使用镀锌钢板为基板的彩色涂 层钢板，除有锌保护外，锌层上的有机涂层起了覆盖隔离作用 ，可防止钢板生锈，使用寿命比镀锌钢板更长，据介绍涂层钢板的使用寿命比镀锌钢板长50%。	In addition to zinc protection, the organic coating on the zinc coating can prevent the steel plate from rusting, and the service life is longer than that of the galvanized steel plate. It is introduced that the service life of the coated steel plate is 50% longer than that of the galvanized steel plate.
但是，在不同的地区和不同的使用部位，采用相同镀锌量、同种涂料、相同涂层厚度的彩色涂层板，其使 用寿命会有很大的不同。例如，在工业区或沿海地区，由于受到空气中二氧化硫气体或盐分的作用，腐蚀速度 加快，使用寿命受到影响。	However, in different areas and different parts of use, the use of the same coating, the same coating, the same coating thickness of color coating board, the service life will be very different. For example, in industrial or coastal areas, due to the role of sulfur dioxide gas or salt in the air, the corrosion rate is accelerated and the service life is affected.
市场上的彩涂板大多都是用于建筑行业，也有极少的一部分会用于其他行业，比如说航空领域、交通运输行业等等，这也就意味着彩涂板对于建筑行业的重要性，也可以说是不可替代了。不过，作为普通人的我们，可以不需要太了解关于彩涂板的知识，只需要知道彩涂板是什么，在彩涂板市场上有什么重要的用途就行了。	Most of the color coating board in the market is used in the construction industry, and a few parts will be used in other industries, such as the aviation industry, transportation and so on, which means that the color coating board is important to the construction industry, and it can be said to be irreplaceable. However, as the ordinary people, we do not need to know much about the color coating plate knowledge, only need to know what color coating is, what important use in the color coating market.
工业厂房、仓库	Industrial buildings and warehouses
彩钢夹芯板主要应用于工业厂房、仓库的屋面和外墙。过去的工业厂房屋面多采用预制混凝土板或石棉板。随着轻钢结构的迅速推广，夹芯板也以其多项显著的优势取代了上述2种材料。	Color steel sandwich panels are mainly used in industrial buildings, roofs and external walls of warehouses. In the past, prefabricated concrete boards or asbestos boards were used in the roofs of industrial buildings. With the rapid expansion of the light steel structure, the 2 kinds of materials have been replaced by the sandwich panels with a number of significant advantages.
在提供更好隔热效果的同时，夹芯板配合已成熟发展的轻钢结构，能够真正体现轻钢体系轻质、快速高效、布置灵活等一系列优势，因而在目前的单层厂房建筑中已成为首选的方案。	While providing better insulation effect, sandwich panels, combined with the developed lightweight steel structure, can truly represent a series of advantages such as lightweight, fast and efficient layout and flexible layout of light steel system, so it has become the first choice in the current single story factory building.
而对于多层工业厂房，除了顶屋的屋面可采用夹芯板外，外墙也可利用夹芯板作灵活的布置，通过彩涂板多变的色彩和形状达到美化建筑外观的目的。对于恒温恒湿要求的工业建筑，采用热工性能优于砖墙的夹芯板作为围护材料，可大大节约建成后的运营成本。	For multi-storey industrial buildings, besides the roof, the roof can be made of sandwich panels. The outer wall can also be flexibly arranged by sandwich panels, and the purpose of beautifying the architectural appearance can be achieved by changing the color and shape of the color coated boards. For the industrial buildings with constant temperature and humidity requirements, the sandwich panels with the thermal performance superior to the brick wall are used as enclosure materials, which can greatly save the operation cost after the completion of the construction.
公共建筑	Public buildings
彩钢夹芯板主要可应用于有大空间需要的公共建筑的屋面和外墙中，如：机制、车站的候机或候车大厅，体育场馆、影剧院和礼堂、展览馆和会展中心、博物馆，等等。	The color steel sandwich panels can be mainly applied to the roofs and exterior walls of public buildings with large space requirements, such as mechanism, station waiting or waiting hall, stadiums, theaters and auditorium, exhibition centers and exhibition centers, museums and so on.
公共建筑由于具有需提供更大的空间、有室内空调、防火等一系列比工业厂房更高要求的特点，目前此类建筑多采用网架或管桁架的屋架结构形式，因此对屋面板的材料在轻质、保温和隔热、防火安全、防水、吸声、耐久性等方面都提出了更高的要求。	Because of the public buildings need to provide more space, indoor air conditioning, fire and a series of industrial buildings than the higher requirements of the characteristics of roof structure the building adopts the grid or pipe truss, the roofing material in light weight, heat preservation and heat insulation, fire prevention, waterproof, sound absorption, durability and safety other aspects are put forward higher requirements.
警示案例	Warning case
2016年12月26日，聊城一处在建工地的彩钢板房突然起火，五辆消防车赶赴现场灭火，所幸事故未造成人员伤亡。	In December 26, 2016, a construction site in Liaocheng, a construction site of the color steel plate room suddenly fire, five fire engines rushed to the scene to fire, the accident did not cause casualties.
2016年12月28日，济源市一彩钢厂内失火，消防部门第一时间赶去灭火，15分钟后火势被控制，没有人员受伤。	In December 28, 2016, Jiyuan City, a color steel plant fire, fire department first time to catch the fire, 15 minutes later the fire was controlled, no people were injured.
无独有偶，就在前不久，郑州一天内发生两次居民自建彩钢板房失火事件，所幸均未造成人员伤亡。	Not long ago, it was not long ago that two times a day in Zhengzhou, there was a fire accident in the building of self built color steel plate house, but no casualties were caused.
我们不禁要问，	We can't help asking,
彩钢板房到底为什么会失火呢？	Why in the end can the color steel plate house lose fire?
首先我们要先了解下彩钢板的分类：	First of all, we should first understand the classification of the color plate.
彩钢板的分类	Classification of color plate
彩钢板因外层有一层颜色涂层的铁皮而得名，具有重量轻、强度高、安装便捷等特点，广泛应用于建设工程施工现场临时性用房。而彩钢板的芯材主要有聚苯乙烯、聚氨酯、岩棉3种。而聚苯乙烯如果不经过阻燃处理属于易燃材料。	Color steel plate is named for its outer coat of iron coated with a color coat. It has the characteristics of light weight, high strength and convenient installation. It is widely applied to temporary housing in construction site. There are 3 main kinds of core materials of color plate, including polystyrene, polyurethane and rock wool. Polystyrene is a flammable material without flame retardant treatment.
从上图中我们可以看到日常彩钢板房中的三种材料，倘若人们因为成本原因未选择燃烧性能等级高的材质来搭建彩钢板房，一旦发生火灾后果不堪设想。	From the above picture, we can see three kinds of materials in the daily color steel plate house. If people do not choose the material with high combustion performance level to build the color steel plate house because of cost reasons, once the fire happens, the consequences will be unthinkable.
我国国家标准GB8624-97将建筑材料的燃烧性能分为以下几种等级。	The national standard GB8624-97 of China divides the combustion performance of building materials into the following grades.
A级：不燃性建筑材料	Class A: non flammable building materials
B1级：难燃性建筑材料	B1 grade: refractory building materials
B2级：可燃性建筑材料	B2 grade: flammable building materials
B3级：易燃性建筑材料	B3 grade: flammable building materials
PS：岩棉类的夹心彩钢板属于A级不燃性的建筑材料	PS: the sandwich colored steel plate of rock wool belongs to a grade a non flammable building material
聚苯乙烯和聚氨酯即便是经过阻燃处理，最高也只能到达B1级	Polystyrene and polyurethane, even after being treated with flame retardancy, can only reach the highest level of B1

彩钢板的使用范围	The scope of use of color steel plate
法律法规	Laws and regulations
根据国家《建筑设计防火规范》要求，建筑确需采用金属夹芯板材时，其芯材应为不燃材料，且耐火极限应符合有关规定。例如矿棉、岩棉、玻璃丝棉、发泡水泥等。幼儿园，养老院，医院，集体宿舍等人员密集场所，一律不得使用低于不燃要求的彩钢板搭建。耐火等级为一级二级的民用建筑建筑构件燃烧性能不应低于A类。	According to the requirements of the national code for fire protection design of buildings, the core material of building should be non combustible material when the building needs to use metal sandwich panels, and the fire resistance limit shall comply with the relevant provisions. Such as mineral wool, rock wool, glass wool, foam cement etc.. Kindergartens, nursing homes, hospitals, dormitories and other crowded places are not allowed to use color steel plates that are less than non burning requirements. The combustion performance of civil building components with grade 1, grade two and grade 1 should not be lower than that of class a.
同时，按照《建设工程施工现场消防安全技术规范》 GB50720的要求，施工现场宿舍、办公建筑物的建筑构件的燃烧性能等级应为A 级。当采用金属夹芯板材时，其芯材的燃烧性能等级应为A 级，同时建筑层数不应超过3 层；发电机房、变配电房、厨房操作间、锅炉房、可燃材料库房及易燃易爆危险品库房的防火设计应符合建筑构件的燃烧性能等级应为A 级，层数应为1 层，建筑面积不应大于200 平方米。	Meanwhile, according to the requirements of GB50720 for fire safety technical specification for construction site, the combustion performance grade of building components for dormitory and office building should be a level. When the metal sandwich board, combustion performance level of its core material should be a level, while building layers should not exceed 3; the fire protection design of generator room, transformer room, kitchen, boiler room, combustible material storehouse and inflammable and explosive dangerous goods depot shall comply with the construction should be a combustion performance level a, the number of layers should be 1 layers, construction area should be less than 200 square meters.

很多在建工地的彩钢板临时用房电气线路设计不规范，未穿管保护，直接把线路铺设在墙面上或者铺设在墙体内部，一旦线路发生短路等故障，极易引发火灾事故。	Many of the color steel plate temporary housing in construction sites are not standardized in design of electrical circuit, and they are not protected by pipes. They directly lay the line on the wall or lay inside the walls. Once the line is short circuited and other faults, it is easy to cause a fire accident.

生活使用不规范	Nonstandard use of life
彩钢板房内存在违规用电、用火的现象，空调、取暖器等电器的存在，成为诱发火灾的因素，加上工人吸烟、乱扔烟头的行为，也会引发火灾。更有甚者，有的人还将电动车放到彩钢房内充电，使得电路负荷严重，大大增加了火灾发生的几率。	There is a phenomenon of illegal use of electricity and fire in the color steel plate house. The existence of electric appliances such as air conditioners and heaters has become a cause of fire. In addition, workers' smoking and cigarette butting will also cause fires. Even more, some people also charge the electric car into the color steel room, which makes the circuit load serious and greatly increases the probability of the fire.

吴参谋提醒您：大家不要在屋顶和建筑内部私自加盖彩钢板房等违章建筑，而且私人住宅中内部改造的时候，尽量不要采用彩钢板，如果必须用，一定要使用燃烧性能为A级的建筑材料，来降低火灾的危险，在平时还要对彩钢板房进行定期维护，这样才能降低火灾发生的可能性。	Wu staff to remind you: we do not in the roof and inside the building privately stamped steel housing and other illegal construction, and internal transformation in a private house, try not to use the color plate, if necessary, be sure to use the combustion properties of a building material, to reduce the risk of fire, usually also on color plate housing regular maintenance, so as to reduce the possibility of fire.
单层厂房钢结构的组成	Composition of steel structure of single storey factory building
厂房结构的组成	The composition of the structure of the factory building
单层厂房钢结构一般是由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架、柱、吊车梁、制动梁（或桁架）、各种支撑以及墙架等构件组成的空间刚性骨架	Steel structure workshop is generally composed of purlin, roof rack, roof, bracket, column, crane beam, brake beam (or truss), space rigid frame and various supporting wall frame components
这些构件按其作用，可归并成下列体系：	These components can be incorporated into the following systems according to their functions:
(1) 横向平面框架——是厂房的基本承重结构，由柱和横梁（屋架）组成。承受作用在厂房的横向水平荷载和竖向荷载并传递到基础。	(1) the horizontal plane frame, the basic load-bearing structure of the plant, is composed of columns and beams (roof frames). The lateral horizontal load and vertical load of the plant are transmitted to the foundation.
(2) 纵向平面框架——由柱、托架、吊车梁及柱间支撑等构成。其作用是保证厂房骨架的纵向不可变形和刚度，承受纵向水平荷载（吊车的纵向制动力、纵向风力等）并传递到基础。	(2) longitudinal plane frame is composed of columns, brackets, columns between crane beam support. Its function is to ensure the vertical deformation and stiffness of the workshop skeleton, and to bear the longitudinal horizontal load (the longitudinal braking force and longitudinal wind force) of the crane, and transmit it to the foundation.
(3) 屋盖系统——由檩条、天窗架、屋架、托架及屋盖支撑等构成。	(3) - roof system composed of purlin, roof rack, roof and roof support bracket, etc..
(4) 吊车梁及制动梁——主要承受吊车的竖向荷载和水平荷载，并传递到横向框架和纵向框架。	(4) the crane beam and the brake beam, which mainly bear the vertical load and horizontal load of the crane, are transferred to the transverse frame and the longitudinal frame.
(5) 支撑——包括屋盖支撑、柱间支撑及其它附加支撑。其作用是将单独的平面框架连成空间体系，以保证结构具有必要的刚度和稳定性，同时也有承受风力及吊车制动力的作用。	(5) support, including roof support, inter column support and other additional support. Its function is to connect a separate plane frame into a space system, so as to ensure that the structure has the necessary stiffness and stability, and also has the function of bearing the power of wind and crane.
(6) 墙架——承受墙体的重量和风力。	(6) a wall frame - bearing the weight of the wall and the wind.
此外，还有一些次要的构件如工作平台、梯子、门窗等。	In addition, there are some minor components, such as work platforms, ladders, doors and windows, etc.
各种构件的用钢量占整个厂房钢结构的总用钢量的比值大致如表所示。	The ratio of steel amount to the total amount of steel used for the entire steel structure of the whole plant is roughly as shown in the table.
厂房按单位面积计算的用钢量，是评定设计的经济合理性的一项重要指标。各类厂房单位面积用钢量的统计数值见下表	The amount of steel used in the workshop by unit area is an important index for evaluating the economic rationality of the design. The statistical value of the amount of steel used in the unit area of all kinds of workshops is shown in the following table
柱的类型	Type of column
柱按结构形式可分为：等截面柱和阶形柱。	The column can be divided into the same section column and the order column according to the structure form.
柱按柱的截面形式分为：实腹式柱和格构式柱。	The column is divided into the concrete column and the lattice column according to the cross section of the column.
柱脚按结构内力的边界条件划分，可分为铰接柱脚和刚性固定柱脚两大类。铰接柱脚仅传递竖向荷载和水平荷载，刚性固定柱脚除传递竖向和水平荷载外，还传递弯矩。刚性固定柱脚就其构造形式可分为三种形式：露出式柱脚、埋入式或插入式柱脚、外包式柱脚。按柱脚的结构形式则可分为整体式柱脚和分离式柱脚。	The column divided by boundary conditions of the internal force of the structure, can be divided into rigid fixed hinged column and column two categories. The hinged column transfer only vertical load and horizontal load, rigid fixed base in addition to transfer of vertical and horizontal loads, but also transfer moment. The structural form of rigid fixed base can be divided into three forms: a type of embedded column, or insert column, column foot. According to the structure of the form of the column can be divided into integral column and separated column.
钢柱的安装方法一般采用三种方法，即采用钢垫板方案、座浆垫板方案和调平螺帽与调平钢板方案。	Three methods are generally used for the installation of steel columns, that is, the steel cushion plate, the slurry cushion and the flat plate and the leveling steel plate.
构件工地拼装	Component site assembly
构件拼装是将若干个分段构件或单件，按设计要求在地面装配成完整的构件或构件组合体。	Component assembly is to assemble a number of piecewise components or single pieces to be assembled into complete components or component combinations on the ground according to the design requirements.
(1) 单一构件拼装	(1) single component assembly
1). 钢柱拼装	1). Steel column assembly
大型钢柱一般在变截面处或肩梁上部分段，进行分段运输。工地拼装后，用焊接或高强度螺栓连接，组成整根柱子进行吊装。	Large steel columns are generally segmented at the variable section or on the upper part of the shoulder beam for subsection transportation. After the construction site is assembled, the whole root column is hoisted with welded or high strength bolts.
首先在一条轴线上设置拼装台架，将钢柱下段吊放到台架上，垫平并确定中心线，再将柱的上段吊放到连接处，使两节柱插接端对准，拼接到位，仔细校准柱的中心轴线和长度尺寸等后，即可按图纸要求进行焊接或高强度螺栓连接固定。	First set the assembling bench at an axis on the steel column under section dipping to bench pad and determine the center line, then the upper column dipping into joints, the two column inserted end alignment, stitching in place, carefully calibrated column size and the length of the central axis, can according to the requirements of the drawings welding or high strength bolt connection fixation.
2). 钢屋架及天窗架拼装	2). Assembly of steel roof truss and skylight frame
一般采用平拼法，即将分块构件平卧于拼装平台上拼装。在起重机性能允许的条件下还可以将天窗架与屋架构件拼装成一体。拼装钢桁架时，要严格控制跨度误差和扭曲，使其不超出允许值。在翻转桁架时，为了防止变形，应确定合理的吊点，必要时还要进行临时加固。	Generally, the flat method is used, which is about to lie on the assembly platform. In the crane performance under permissible conditions can also be integrated with the roof member day window frame assembly. When the steel truss is assembled, the span error and distortion should be strictly controlled so that it does not exceed the allowable value. In order to prevent the deformation of the truss, a reasonable lifting point should be determined and temporary reinforcement should be carried out when necessary.
对于有天窗的大跨度屋架或高度较大的桁架，应用立拼法拼装，因为这种桁架的翻转是非常困难的。	For a large span roof truss with a skylight or a high height truss, a spelling spelling is applied, because the flipping of this truss is very difficult.
(1) 构件组合拼装	(1) component assembly and assembly
当具备大型起重机械，且按照条件允许时，可将诸多构件在地面拼装成一个稳定单元块体，进行整体吊装。这样可减少高空作业，有利于安全施工和提高工作效率，保证构件吊装的稳定性。例如两榀屋架与斜撑组合拼装、斜桥构架及通廊桁架组合拼装等。	When a large lifting machine is available and the conditions permit, a number of components can be assembled into a stable unit block on the ground to be hoisted as a whole. In this way, the operation of high altitude can be reduced, the safety construction and the efficiency of work can be improved, and the stability of the hoisting of the components is ensured. For example, two pieces of roof and brace assembly, bridge frame and truss corridor assembly etc..
构件组合拼装在安装现场进行，拼装位置必须在安装起重机的作用范围内。拼装的项目和规模必须根据起重机的性能、构件的强度、刚度、稳定性及施工环境等因素确定。	The component assembly is assembled at the installation site, and the assembly position must be within the scope of the installation of the crane. The project and scale of the assembly must be determined according to the performance of the crane, the strength of the component, the stiffness, the stability and the construction environment.
垫板设置	Cushion plate setting
(1) 柱底板下设置的支承垫板应符合下列规定：	(1) the supporting pad under the bottom of the column shall be in accordance with the following provisions:
a. 垫板应设置在靠近地脚螺栓的柱脚底板加劲板下，每根地脚螺栓侧应设1～2组垫板。垫板与基础面得接触应平整、紧密。二次浇灌混凝土前垫板组间应点焊固定。	A. plate should be set in the base plate of stiffened plates near the anchor bolt, with 1 to 2 groups each side of the anchor bolt plate should be. The contact of the pad and the base should be smooth and tight. The two time pouring concrete front pad group should be fixed by spot welding.
b. 每组垫板板叠不宜超过5块，垫板宜外露出柱底板10～30mm。	B. the padding of each mat board should not exceed 5 pieces, and the cushion plate should reveal the bottom plate of 10 ~ 30mm.

b. 宜根据测得的柱底面至牛腿距离决定每个基础垫	B. should determine each base pad based on the distance from the bottom of the column to the leg.
钢结构工程的施工	Construction of steel structure engineering
1、要切实作好钢结构制作及安装单位的考察与选择工作	1. The investigation and selection of the production and installation units of the steel structure should be conscientiously done.
我们知道，钢结构工程的施工要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，这两个阶段可由一个施工单位完成，但有时也可能由两个单位分别完成（分包）。切实作好钢结构制作单位和安装单位的考察与选择工作，对于确保钢结构工程质量及进度，具有重要意义。钢结构制作、安装单位的考察内容主要有：企业资质，生产规模，技术人员数量、职称及履历，技术工人数量及资格证，机械设备情况，以及业绩情况等级。点这免费下载施工技术资料	As we know, the construction of steel structure has to go through two stages: Factory fabrication and on-site installation. These two stages can be completed by a construction unit, but sometimes it can be completed by two units separately. It is of great significance to ensure the quality and progress of the steel structure engineering by making a good work on the inspection and selection of the production units and installation units of steel structures. The research contents of the production and installation of steel structure mainly include: enterprise qualification, production scale, number of technical personnel, professional title and resume, number of technical workers, qualification certificates, machinery and equipment, and performance level.

2、严格审查承包单位提交的钢结构制作工艺及安装施工组织设计	2. Strictly examine the design of the steel construction technology and the installation and construction organization submitted by the contractor
施工组织设计是承包单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，认真审查施工组织设计是监理工作事前控制和主动控制的重要内容。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计，其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施，如关键零件的加工方法，主要构件的工艺流程、工艺措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document guiding the Contractor's activities in the whole construction process. The careful review of construction organization design is an important part of pre control and active control in supervision work. Steel structure engineering for production and installation stage respectively in the preparation of construction organization design and installation of production process, the production process includes the production stage of each process and each sub quality standards, technical requirements, and to ensure the quality of products and to develop the specific measures, such as the key parts of the processing method, technological process, main component the process measures, processing equipment, the process equipment etc..
3、要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作	3, we should pay full attention to the supervision work in the production stage
如前所述，钢结构工程均要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段，而制作和安装一般是由钢结构工程公司下属的两个基层单位（制作车间和安装项目部）分别负责，有时还可能由制造厂和安装公司两个单位分别完成（分包）。监理工程师要充分重视制作阶段的监理工作，要象其他类型工程的监理工作一样，切实搞好事前控制和事中控制，对各工序、各分项都要做到检查认真而及时、严格而到位。要避免那种放松工厂制作过程的监理，仅靠构件完成后进场验收的错误工作方法。这一点在制作单位距工程所在地路程较远的情况下，尤其要注意。	As mentioned earlier, the steel structure engineering must pass through factory production and installation of two stages, and the production and installation is two units under the steel structure engineering company (production workshop and installation project department) are responsible for, and sometimes were completed by the factory and the company installed two units (including package). The supervision engineer should pay enough attention to the supervision work in the production stage, like the supervision work of other types of projects, do well the control before and in the middle affairs, and check every process and sub item strictly, timely and strictly. It is necessary to avoid the supervision of the process of relaxing factory production, and the wrong method of working for the post acceptance check only by the component. This point should be paid attention to in the case that the production unit is far away from the site of the project.
4、安装阶段的监理	4, the supervision of the installation stage
钢结构安装阶段的监理工作内容主要是监督承包单位内部管理体系和质保体系的运行情况，督促落实施工组织设计的各项技术、组织措施，严格按照国家现行钢结构有关规范、标准进行施工。钢结构安装阶段的监理工作应重点抓好以下几个环节：安装方案的合理性和落实情况、安装测量、高强度螺栓的连接、安装焊接质量、安装尺寸偏差的实测、涂装等。监理工作要加强现场巡视检查、平行检验和旁站监督，尤其是在目前部分钢结构施工单位素质偏低，施工仍欠规范的情况下，切实做好现场巡视和旁站，对于确保钢结构工程的施工质量，更有现实意义。	The supervision work of steel structure installation stage is the main operation of the supervision contractor internal management system and quality assurance system, supervise the implementation of the technology, organization design measures of construction, the construction in strict accordance with the current national norms and standards of steel structure. During the installation phase of steel structure, we should focus on the following aspects: the rationality and implementation of installation plan, installation and measurement, connection of high-strength bolts, installation and welding quality, installation size deviation measurement and painting. To strengthen the supervision of site inspection, site of parallel inspection and supervision, especially in the current unit part of steel structure construction quality is low, the construction is still owed norms, to do on-site inspection and supervision, to ensure the construction quality of steel structure engineering, more practical significance.
5、关于钢结构工程的试验检测工作	5. On testing and testing of steel structure engineering
钢结构工程的制作及安装施工的多项试验检测工作是一般土建工程所没有的，这些试验检测项目主要有：钢材原材有关项目的检测（必要时），焊接工艺评定试验（必要时），焊缝无损检测（超声波、X射线、磁粉等）、高强度螺栓扭矩系数或预拉力试验、高强度螺栓连接面抗滑移系数检测、钢网架节点承载力试验、钢结构防火涂料性能试验等。	Production and installation of the number of test work of steel structure engineering is the general civil engineering does not, these test items include: detection of steel raw material of the project (if necessary), welding procedure qualification test (if necessary), non destructive testing of weld (super sonic, X ray, magnetic powder, etc.) the strength of bolt torque coefficient or pre tension test, high strength bolt connection surface detection, anti slip coefficient of steel truss joint bearing capacity test and performance test of steel structure fire retardant coating.
作好这些试验、检测工作要注意以下几点：	The following points should be paid attention to in doing these tests and testing.
（1）要监督委托有相应资质的检测机构进行；	(1) to supervise the inspection agencies entrusted with corresponding qualifications;
（2）要坚持取样、送检的见证制度，要避免试件与工程不一致现象；	(2) we should adhere to the witness system of sampling and inspection, and avoid the inconsistency between the test pieces and the project.
（3）对于部分检测项目，具有相应资质的检测机构较少，路程较远，且费用较高，在这种情况下，监理工程师必须坚持原则，态度明确，立场坚定，及时督促承包单位落实这些工作，这是确保钢结构制作与安装质量及施工进度的必要措施，也是国家现行钢结构工程施工质量验收规范规定的“主控项目”。	(3) for some test items, with the corresponding qualification testing organization is less, the distance, and the cost is higher, in this case, the engineer must adhere to the principle of a clear attitude, stand firm, to urge the contractor to implement these work, it is necessary to ensure the measures of steel structure fabrication and installation quality and construction schedule the main control program, the current national regulations and steel structure construction quality acceptance "".
6、钢结构工程其它几个重要质量控制点	6. Some other important quality control points for steel structure engineering
6.1 地脚螺栓的预埋	The preembedding of 6.1 anchor bolts
地脚螺栓的预埋质量直接影响钢结构的安装质量，控制好地脚螺栓（群）的位置、垂直度、长度和标高，对于减少扩孔及调整工作量（甚至避免返工），提高结构安装质量具有重要意义。地脚螺栓的预埋方法可采用直接预埋法，也可采用预留孔法。基础砼浇筑前监理工程师必须严格检查预埋螺栓施工方法的合理性、可靠性，以及各项实测指标是否在规范规定范围内。点这免费下载施工技术资料	The embedment quality of anchor bolts directly affects the installation quality of steel structures. Controlling the location, perpendicularity, length and elevation of anchor bolts is of great significance for reducing reaming and adjusting workload, or even avoiding rework, and improving the quality of structure installation. The pre embedding method of the anchor bolts can be used directly, and the reserved hole method can be used. Before the foundation concrete is poured, the supervision engineer must strictly check the rationality and reliability of the construction method of the embedded bolts, and whether the measured indicators are within the prescribed limits.

6.2 焊接工程质量控制	6.2 quality control of welding engineering
焊接工程是钢结构制作和安装工程最重要的分项之一，监理工程师必须从事前准备，施焊过程和成品检验各个环节，切实作好焊接工程的质量控制工作。目前，我市钢结构施工单位绝大部分都具备自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，仅在个	Welding engineering is one of the most important sub items in the fabrication and installation works of steel structure. The supervision engineer must engage in the preparation, welding process and inspection of finished products, and do well the quality control work of welding engineering. At present, most of the construction units of steel structure in our city have automatic submerged arc welding machines, some of which have semi-automatic gas protection welding machines.
随着国家节能减排要求的步步推进，建筑也被打上了环保的标签，打造宜居建筑的材料在钢结构与木结构之间展开了激烈的角逐。	As the national energy saving and emission reduction requirements are advancing step by step, buildings are also labeled with environmental protection. The materials for building livable buildings have been competing fiercely between steel structures and wood structures.
在这里，我们简要的分析下钢结构住宅与木结构房屋的区别：	Here, we briefly analyze the difference between the steel structure housing and the wood structure housing.
一、经济方面	1. Economic aspect
钢结构住宅的经济性是阻碍钢结构住宅发展的最大障碍，根据我们国家现有的钢结构发展水平，钢结构住宅的土建造价要比钢筋混凝土住宅高10%~20%左右，但钢结构住宅较混凝土结构在基础造价上可节约30％，且钢结构住宅的得房率较混凝土住宅高7％～10％，此外钢结构住宅的施工工期也可减少约30％。	The economy of the steel structure housing is the biggest obstacle to the development of steel structure residence, according to the development level of steel structure existing in our country, the steel structure housing construction cost than the reinforced concrete housing about 10%~20% high, but compared with the steel structure housing concrete structure based on cost savings of 30%, and the steel structure residential housing rate a concrete residential high 7% to 10%, in addition to the construction of residential steel structure can also be reduced by about 30%.
就目前国内进口的木结构房屋而言，成本价一般要在4000~8000人民币每平方米，可见要远远高于普通的钢筋混凝土和砌体房屋的造价，这对于一般开发商和普通用户都是难以接受。但是，随着我国经济的高速发展，高收入群体的逐步形成和壮大，他们消费意思的成熟和生活品位的提升，这种“温暖”的，与大自然容融为一体的绿色环保型住房肯定是有市场的。	For the imported wooden structure houses at present, the cost price is generally 4000~8000 yuan per square meter, which is much higher than the cost of ordinary reinforced concrete and masonry buildings, which is hard for ordinary developers and ordinary users to accept. However, with the rapid development of China's economy and the gradual formation and growth of high-income groups, the maturity of their consumption and the improvement of their taste of life, this "warm" green environmental friendly housing that is integrated with the nature is sure to have a market.
钢结构住宅与木结构房屋造价相对于砖混结构来说相对较高，一般消费群体短期内接受的可能性不大，站到环保节能的角度上，钢结构住宅能够充分再利用占有很强的优势，据调查表明，随着国民生活水平的提高，汽车的持有量在成倍递增，随之而来报废汽车的回收问题将越来越突出。钢结构的循环利用也许是解决这个问题的有效途径之一。	The steel structure housing and wooden houses of brick and concrete structure is relatively high compared to the cost, the possibility of the general consumer groups in the short term is not acceptable, to environmental protection and energy saving point of view, the steel structure housing can fully reuse occupies a strong advantage, according to the survey, with the improvement of living standard, Automobile Holdings in multiples with increasing scrap recycling of cars will become more and more prominent. The recycling of steel structure may be one of the effective ways to solve this problem.
一幢木结构建筑则需要耗费树龄大约10年左右的树木，大量木结构房屋的建造有悖于节能环保的初衷，危害在此不做赘述。	A wooden structure needs trees that are about 10 years old. A lot of wooden houses are built against the original intention of energy saving and environmental protection.
二、抗震性能	Two, seismic performance
进入21世纪以来，大自然开始用一系列的自我保护措施来提醒人类对自然资源的不节制开发和浪费。灾难仿佛悬在人类头顶的利刃，似乎相隔很远，却又近在身边。	Since twenty-first Century, nature has begun to use a series of self - protection measures to remind human beings of the uncontrolled development and waste of natural resources. The disaster seems to be hanging on the top of the human head, and it seems to be far away, but close to it.
好的建筑，除了宜居之外，安全的重要性不言而喻。	In good buildings, in addition to livability, the importance of security is self-evident.
钢结构具有良好的延展性，可以将地震波的能耗抵消掉。钢材基本上属各向同性材料，扛拉、抗压、扛剪强度均很高，而且具有良好的延展性，特别是钢结构凭着自己特有的高延展性减轻了地震反应。钢结构还可以看作比较理想的弹塑性结构，可以通过结构的塑性变形吸收和消耗地震输入能量，从而具有较高的抵抗强烈地震的能力。钢结构相对于其他结构自重轻，这也大大减轻了地震作用的影响。	The steel structure has good ductility, energy consumption can be offset by seismic wave. Steel products are basically isotropic materials. They have high tensile strength, compressive strength and shear strength, and have good ductility, especially steel structures, which mitigate earthquake responses by their own high ductility. Steel structure can also be considered as an ideal elastic-plastic structure, which can absorb and consume seismic input energy through structural plastic deformation, thus having a strong ability to resist strong earthquakes. The steel structure is lighter than other structures, which greatly reduces the effect of seismic action.
木结构也有一定的抗震作用，但是因为木结构建筑的层数一般较低，不适应越来越紧张的土地资源，达不到高层建筑的要求。	Timber structure also has some aseismic function, but because the storeys of timber structure are generally low, which is not suitable for more and more intense land resources, and cannot meet the requirements of high-rise buildings.
钢结构住宅与木结构房屋有一定的相似性，站在长远发展的角度上，钢结构住宅的推广和广泛使用才是我们未来的可行性选择。	Steel structure housing is similar to wooden structure housing. From the perspective of long-term development, the promotion and wide use of steel structure housing is our future feasible choice.
随着现代经济的不断发展，钢结构工程以其施工速度快、周期短、强度高、便于预制、安装、适用高层大跨度等的优越性已在工程领域广泛应用。而过去，我国大量采用钢筋混凝土结构和预应力混凝土结构，现场工程技术人员比较缺乏钢结构工程的施工经验，施工质量的好坏直接影响工程结构的安全。因而，钢结构工程的质量问题也越来越引起人们的重视，因此加强钢结构工程施工质量控制，具有很重要的现实意义和必要性。	With the continuous development of modern economy, steel structure engineering has been widely applied in engineering field due to its superiority in construction speed, short cycle, high strength, prefabrication, installation and high rise and large span. In the past, a lot of reinforced concrete structures and prestressed concrete structures were used in our country. The field engineers and technicians lack the experience of steel structure construction. The quality of construction directly affects the safety of engineering structures. Therefore, the quality problem of steel structure is attracting more and more attention. Therefore, strengthening the quality control of steel structure construction is of great practical significance and necessity.
1、施工准备	1. Construction preparation
施工准备是建设施工创造必须条件，认真、细致、深入地做好施工准备工作，对充分发挥人的积极因素，合理组织人力、物力，加快工程进度，提供施工质量，节约投资和材料，对顺利完成钢结构建设任务起着重要的作用。	The construction preparation is to create conditions for construction, carefully and thoroughly make preparation for construction work, to make full use of the positive factors, the rational organization of human and material resources, speed up the progress of the project, to provide the quality of construction, saving investment and material, to successfully complete the task of building steel structure plays an important role.
1.1认真做好施工图纸的会审和交底工作点这免费下载施工技术资料	1.1 do a good job of construction drawing and construction work of the construction of technical data for free download
图纸是工程施工的依据，工程项目技术负责人应组织有关技术人员对图纸进行分工审阅和消化，其目的一是使施工单位和各参建单位熟悉设计图纸，了解工程特点和设计意图，找出需要解决的技术难题，并制定解决方案；二是为了解决图纸中存在的问题，减少图纸的差错，将图纸中的质量隐患消灭在萌芽之中。同时做好技术交底，做好施工和设计的结合、做好钢结构吊装与土建施工、钢结构和混凝土构预制的结合。	Drawing is the basis for project construction, project technical director should organize relevant technical staff work review and digestion of the drawings, the purpose is to make the construction units and construction units are familiar with design drawings, understand the engineering characteristics and the design intention, to find out the technical problems need to be solved, and develop solutions; the two is to solve drawing problems, reduce drawing errors, quality problems in the drawing will be nipped in the bud. At the same time, we should do a good job of technical basis, do well the combination of construction and design, do a good job of the combination of steel structure hoisting and civil construction, steel structure and concrete precast.
1.2认真编制钢结构工程施工组织设计	1.2 carefully compile the construction organization design of steel structure engineering
施工组织设计是施工单位编制的指导工程施工全过程各项活动的重要综合性技术文件，是一个科学的管理方法。施工单位在编制施工组织和施工方案时，须从人、机、料、法、环五个方面制定切实可行的具体实施细则，落实计划，落实组织人员，落实自检、互检和专检，把容易出现的质量问题全部纳入受控状态，确保方案技术措施得力、可行。在编制和贯彻施工组织设计过程中应做到广泛深入的研究，向施工人员交底，做到人人把关。钢结构工程要针对制作阶段和安装阶段分别编制制作工艺和安装施工组织设计。其中制作工艺内容应包括制作阶段各工序、各分项的质量标准、技术要求，以及为保证产品质量而制订的各项具体措施。钢结构安装工程施工组织设计内容有质量保证体系和技术管理体系的建立、质量、进度控制的措施和方法、施工工期的安排等。	Construction organization design is an important comprehensive technical document which is compiled by the construction unit to guide all activities in the whole process of construction, and it is a scientific management method. The construction units in the construction organization and construction plan, to implement the plan from human, machine, material, method and environment five aspects to develop specific implementation details, practical implementation, organization of personnel, the implementation of self inspection, mutual inspection and special inspection, the quality problems of all included in the controlled state, to ensure technical measures effective and feasible scheme. In the preparation and implementation of the construction organization design process should be done in a wide and in-depth study, to the builders to the bottom, so that everyone checks. The steel structure engineering should prepare the production process and the installation organization design for the production stage and the installation stage respectively. The manufacturing process should include quality standards, technical requirements, and specific measures to ensure product quality.

2、重视钢结构基础工程的质量控制	2. Attach importance to quality control of steel structure foundation engineering
钢结构基础工程的质量控制一般指钢结构基础预埋螺栓的质量控制，预埋螺栓是整个工程施工的第一步，也是非常关键的一步，是整个工程的基础。施工基础预埋螺栓时首先熟悉图纸，了解图纸的意图，应制作安装模板。预埋螺栓用两安装模板及钢筋定位在柱子的主筋和模板上，保证预埋螺栓不受土建浇注混凝土施工而移位。这样每组螺栓之间的间距、高低可控制在允许的误差范围内；同时，保护好螺栓丝扣，在混凝土浇筑时不被损坏。土建工程完工后，用经纬仪和水准仪对地脚螺栓的标高、轴线进行复查，并做好记录。并交下一道工序验收。	The quality control of steel structure foundation engineering generally refers to the quality control of the embedded bolts of steel structure foundation. The embedded bolts are the first step and the key step of the whole project construction, which is the foundation of the whole project. When the bolt is buried in the construction foundation, it is familiar with the drawings and the intention of the drawings. The installation of the template should be made. The pre buried bolt is positioned on the main rib and the template of the column with two installation template and steel bar, so as to ensure that the buried bolt is not moved by the construction of concrete pouring concrete. Between the distance and the height of each bolt can be controlled in the allowable error range; at the same time, to protect the bolt thread is not damaged, in concrete pouring. After the completion of the civil engineering, the height and axis of the anchor bolts are rechecked with the theodolite and the leveling instrument, and the records are made well. And submit a procedure for acceptance.
3、钢结构制作工程质量控制	3. Quality control of steel construction engineering
钢结构工程的施工通常要经过工厂制作和现场安装两个阶段。钢结构工程有大部分时间是在工厂车间内部进行，由于钢结构构件在工厂内加工制造的质量好坏，对钢结构工程的现场安装及整体结构的安全稳定至关重要。因此钢结构制作生产厂家必须具备相应企业资质、生产规模、技术能力、机械设备及先进的工艺水平。	The construction of steel structure engineering usually passes through two stages of factory production and site installation. Steel structure works are mostly carried out in the workshop within most of the time. Because the quality of the steel structure components in the factory is critical for the on-site installation of the steel structure engineering and the safety and stability of the whole structure. Therefore, the production manufacturers of steel structure must have the corresponding enterprise qualification, production scale, technical ability, mechanical equipment and advanced technological level.
钢结构一般制作工艺流程分为:放样→下料→拼板→切割→组立→埋弧焊接→钻孔→组装→矫正成型→铆工零配件下料→制作组装→焊接和焊接检验→防锈处理、涂装、编号→构件验收出厂。在钢结构制作中，应根据钢结构制作工艺流程，抓住关键工序进行质量控制，如控制关键零件的加工，主要构件的工艺、措施，所采用的加工设备、工艺装备等。	The general structure of steel production process is divided into: lofting, blanking, plate, cutting, assembling, submerged arc welding, hole drilling, assembly and correction of parts forming, riveting blanking, manufacturing and assembling, welding and welding inspection, anti rust treatment, coating, and component factory approval number. In the production of steel structure, we should take quality control according to the process of steel structure and grasp the key processes, such as controlling the processing of key parts, the process and measures of main components, the processing equipment, process equipment and so on.
4、重视焊接工程质量控制	4. Attach importance to quality control of welding engineering
在钢结构制作和安装工程工程中焊接工程是最重要的环节，必须重视焊接工程质量控制。目前，钢结构在生产过程中大部分采用具自动埋弧焊机，部分具备半自动气体保护焊机，个别部位采用手工施焊。焊接质量问题较多存在于手工焊缝，这些问题有：焊瘤、夹渣、气孔、没焊透、咬边、错边、焊缝尺寸偏差大、不用引弧板、焊接变形不矫正、飞溅物清理不净等。鉴于这种情况，钢结构施焊前，对焊条的合格证要进行检查，按说明书要求使用，焊工必须持证上岗证，焊缝表面不	Welding engineering in the construction and installation of steel structure is the most important link, and the quality control of the welding engineering must be paid attention to. At present, most of the steel structures are equipped with automatic submerged arc welding machines, partly with semi-automatic gas shielded welding machines, and some parts are manually welded. Many problems exist in the welding quality manual welding, these problems are: welding slag, porosity, no penetration, undercut, mismatch, weld size deviation, no arc plate, welding deformation correction, spatter clean-up net etc.. In view of this situation, before welding the steel structure, the qualification certificate of the electrode should be inspected, and the welder must have the certificate of license and the surface of the weld.
一、啥叫彩钢？	First, what is called color steel?
彩色涂层钢板，俗称彩钢板，以冷轧钢板镀上其他金属非金属或合金（锌、铝、镁、锰、硅等）为基板，经过表面处理转化后（脱脂、磷化、铬酸盐），涂覆有机涂层经烘烤制成，具有轻质高强、色彩鲜艳、耐久性好等特点。广泛应用于建筑、家电、装潢、汽车等领域。	Color coated steel plate, commonly known as color steel plate, cold rolled steel plated to other metal non metal or alloy (aluminum, zinc, magnesium, manganese, silicon etc.) as substrate, after surface treatment after transformation (degreasing, phosphating, chromate), organic coatings made by baking, has the characteristics of high strength, bright color, durability good. Widely used in architecture, home appliances, decoration, automobiles and other fields.
彩钢板的强度取决于基板材料和厚度，耐久性取决于镀层、表面涂层和加工工艺，涂层有聚酯涂层（PE）、氟碳涂层（PVDF）、硅改性涂层（SMP）、高耐侯涂层（HDP）、丙稀酸涂层、聚氨脂涂层（PU）、塑料溶胶涂层（PVC）	Color steel plate strength depends on the substrate material and thickness, durability depends on the coating, surface coating and processing technology, coated with polyester coating (PE), fluorocarbon coating (PVDF), silicon modified coating (SMP), high corrosion resistance coating (HDP), acrylic acid, polyurethane coating, plastic coating (PU) sol coating (PVC)
等。涂层结构有二涂一烘、二涂二烘等，免维护使用年限根据环境大气不同可为10－30年。	Etc.. The coating structure has two coating, one baking, two coating and two baking, etc. the maintenance free service life can be 10-30 years depending on the ambient atmosphere.
涂层结构	Coating structure
上表面 下表面	The lower surface of the upper surface
一次涂层 不涂 1/0	One coat is not coated with 1/0
一次涂层 一次涂层 1/1	One coat once coating 1/1
二次涂层 不涂 2/0	The two coating is not coated with 2/0
二次涂层 一次涂层 2/1	Two coating one coat 2/1
二次涂层 二次涂层 2/2	Two coating two coat 2/2
二、常用涂料	Two, commonly used coatings
1、聚酯(PE、Polyester )	1, polyester (PE, Polyester)
PE涂料对于材质有良好的附着性，彩涂钢板易于加工成型，价廉且产品多，颜色和光泽的选择余地大。聚酯涂料对耐紫外光性与涂膜耐粉化性，并不理想，因此PE涂料的使用仍需受到一些限制，一般用在空气污染不严重的地区或需多次成型加工的产品。	PE coating has good adhesion to the material. Color coated steel sheet is easy to process, low price and many products, and the choice of color and luster is great. Polyester coatings are not ideal for UV resistance and film coating resistance, so the use of PE coatings still need some restrictions, generally used in areas where air pollution is not serious or need to be processed several times.
2、硅改性聚酯（SMP,Silicone Mobified Polyester)	2, silicon modified polyester (SMP, Silicone, Mobified, Polyester)
由于聚酯含有活性基-OH/-COOH，极易和其它高分子化和物反应，为改良PE的耐阳光性与粉化性，以色泽保持性与耐热性优的Silicone树脂作变性反应，和PE的变性比可于5%—50%之间，SMP提供钢板更好的持久性，其防蚀年限可长达10-12年，当然其价格也比较PE为高，但因Silicone树脂对材质的附着性和加工成型性并不理想，因此SMP彩涂钢板并不适用于需多次成型加工的场合，大部分用于建筑屋顶及外墙。	Because the polyester containing active base -OH/-COOH, easy and other polymer and reaction is improved PE resistance and pulverization of the sun, to maintain color and excellent heat resistance of Silicone resin modified reaction, and PE ratio from 5% to 50% between degeneration, persistent SMP plate provides better, the anti corrosion period can be up to 10-12 years, of course, the price is relatively high in PE, but due to material adhesion and molding of Silicone resin is not ideal, so SMP color coated steel plate is not suitable for multiple processing occasions, mostly used for building roof and exterior wall.
3、高耐侯聚酯(HDP、High durable Polyster)	3, high durability polyester (HDP, High durable Polyster)
对于PE和SMP的缺点，英国HYDRO公司（现被BASF收购）、瑞典的BECKER等在2000年初其开发出可达到PVDF涂层60-80%耐候性HDP聚酯涂料，且优于普通的硅改性聚酯涂料，其户外耐候性达到15年。高耐候聚酯树脂在合成时采用含环己烷结构的单体，来达到树脂的柔韧性、耐候性和成本的平衡，采用不含芳香族的多元醇和多元酸来减少树脂对UV光线的吸收，达到涂料的高耐候性能。涂料配方中加入紫外线吸收剂和位阻胺（HALS）提高漆膜耐候性能。高耐候聚酯卷材涂料在国外已被市场认可，该涂料性价比十分突出。	For the shortcomings of PE and SMP, the British HYDRO company (now acquired by BASF), Sweden's BECKER and so on, in the early 2000, it developed PVDF coating 60-80% weather resistant HDP polyester coating, and better than ordinary silicone modified polyester coating, its outdoor weathering resistance reached 15 years. High weather resistant polyester resin with monomer containing cyclohexane structure in synthesis, to achieve the flexibility of the resin, durability and cost balance, which did not contain aromatic polyols and polybasic acid to reduce the absorption of resin for UV light, high weatherability of coatings. Adding ultraviolet absorber and hindered amine (HALS) in coating formula to improve weatherability of paint film. High weather resistant polyester coil coating has been recognized in foreign markets, and its performance is very outstanding.
4、PVC 塑料溶胶（PVC Plastisol）	4, PVC sol (PVC Plastisol)
PVC树脂有很好的耐水性和耐化学药品性，一般以高固形份涂装，其涂装厚度于l00-300μm之间，能提供平滑的PVC涂膜或轻压花处理作压花涂膜;由于PVC涂膜为热可塑性树脂，具有高膜厚，能提供钢板良好的保护。但PVC耐热性较弱。在早期在欧洲使用较多，由于其环保属性相对较差，目前使用越来越少。	PVC resin has good water resistance and chemical resistance, with high solid content of coating, the coating thickness between l00-300 m, can provide a smooth PVC film or light embossing processing for embossing coating; PVC coating due for thermoplastic resin, with high film thickness, can provide protection for steel plate good. But the heat resistance of PVC is weak. It was used more frequently in Europe in the early stage, because of its relatively poor environmental protection properties, the current use of less and less.
5、PVDF	5, PVDF
由于PVDF的化学键与化学键间，有很强的键能，因此涂料具有非常好的防蚀性和色泽保持性，在建筑工业用彩涂钢板涂料中，是属于最高级产品，且分子量大又为直键型结构，因此除耐化学药品性之外，机械性能、耐紫外线和耐热性能也很突出。在一般环境下，其防蚀年限可达20—25年之久。近年来，国内开始盛行以三氟氯乙烯和乙烯酯单体共聚的含氟树脂，大量应用于建筑的外墙和金属板，由于使用易水解的乙烯酯单体和氟的含量较PVDF低30%左右，因此其耐候性与PVDF比较，有一定的差距。宝钢所生产的氟碳涂层，其涂层PVDF含量不小于70%（其他为丙稀酸树脂）。	Due to chemical bonding and chemical bonding between PVDF, there is a strong bond energy, so the coating has good corrosion resistance and color retention, in the construction industry with painted steel coatings, is among the most advanced products, and large molecular weight and straight bond type structure, so in addition to chemical resistance besides, the mechanical properties, UV resistance and heat resistance is also very prominent. In general environment, the corrosion prevention period can reach 20 - 25 years. In recent years, the country has become popular with fluorine resin containing fluorine three vinyl chloride and vinyl monomers, is widely used in the construction of the wall and the metal plate, the 30% low hydrolysis of vinyl ester monomer and the fluorine content is about PVDF, so the weather resistance compared with PVDF, there is a certain gap. Fluorocarbon coating produced by Baosteel, the content of PVDF is not less than 70% (the other is acrylic resin).
6、聚氨酯	6, polyurethane
近年所开发的一个面漆新品种，综合性能优异，价格昂贵，正在推广中。	A new top coat developed in recent years, which has excellent comprehensive performance and high price, is being popularized.
7、丙稀酸树脂	7, acrylic resin
综合性能好，价格昂贵，只在特定领域内使用（如集装箱用）。	Comprehensive performance is good, expensive, only in a specific field (such as container).

一、建筑钢结构发展的新契机	First, a new opportunity for the development of building steel structure
建筑钢结构自面世以来，因其相对于传统建筑材料的诸多优点而被广泛应用到建筑结构中。随着我国钢产量逐年增加并连续多年稳居世界第一，钢结构在我国得到了快速发展。目前钢结构主要应用于大跨度以及超高层等能充分显示其优势的结构体系中，而在其他类型建筑，如住宅、商业建筑中应用偏少。	Since the advent of building steel structure, because of its advantages compared with traditional building materials, it has been widely used in building structures. With the increase of China's steel production year by year, and for many years ranked first in the world, the steel structure in China has been rapid development. At present, steel structure is mainly used in large span and super high-rise structure system which can fully display its advantages, while in other types of buildings, such as residential, commercial buildings, the application is less.
2016年《政府工作报告》明确提出“积极推广绿色建筑和建材，大力发展钢结构和装配式建筑，提高建筑工程标准和质量······”；北京市《关于加快发展装配式建筑的实施意见》“鼓励学校、医院、体育馆、商场、写字楼等新建公共建筑优先采用钢结构建筑，其中政府投资的单体地上建筑面积1万平米（含）以上的新建公共建筑应采用钢结构建筑”。钢结构是绿色环保和最适合装配的结构材料，在建筑工业化浪潮及钢铁行业“去库存”的大环境下，如何冲破桎梏，发挥其优势，造福社会，是摆在从业人员面前的一个课题。	2016 "government work report" clearly put forward "actively promote green building and building materials, vigorously develop the steel structure and prefabricated construction, improve construction standards and quality ---"; Beijing city "on accelerating the development of assembly type building" opinions "to encourage schools, hospitals, stadiums, shopping malls, office buildings the new public buildings give priority to the use of steel structure building, one single government investment in the construction area of 10 thousand square meters (inclusive) above new public buildings should adopt the steel structure construction". The steel structure is green and the most suitable assembly structure in building materials, the industrialization and the steel industry to the inventory of the environment, how to break the shackles, give play to its advantage, benefit the society, a subject is placed in front of the staff.
二、钢结构建筑的火灾危险性	Two. Fire hazard of steel structure building
钢结构在火灾中的表现是由钢材的物理性能决定的。根据研究，在200℃以下，其强度折减不多，甚至在某个区间还有一定程度的升高；在高于200℃的情况下其强度随着火场温度升高迅速下降，600~800℃时，几乎彻底丧失承载能力。火场温度一般均在800~1000℃以上，如下图1所示，无防护的裸露钢结构会在15min后失效。	The performance of steel structure in fire is determined by the physical properties of steel. According to the study, at 200 DEG C, the strength reduction is not much, even in a certain range and a certain level of increase; in case of more than 200 degrees with the strength of the fire temperature decreased rapidly, 600~800 degrees, almost complete loss of bearing capacity. The fire temperature is generally above 800~1000 degrees. As shown in Figure 1, the bare steel structure without protection will fail after 15min.
图1 高温下钢材强度的折减系数与升温曲线图	Figure 1 reduction factor and temperature rising curve of steel strength at high temperature
钢材的失效极易造成建筑物的倒塌，无防护或防护不到位的钢结构建筑一旦发生火灾往往造成特大恶性事故。1998年北京某家具城火灾造成1.3万平米钢结构全部倒塌；2003年青岛某食品加工厂火灾，钢屋架倒塌导致未能及时疏散的几十名员工死亡；······因此，做好钢结构防火保护工作，对于保障生命财产安全，杜绝恶性事故的发生具有十分重要的现实意义。	The failure of steel is easy to cause the collapse of the building, and the steel structure building which is not protected or not protected will cause serious accidents. In 1998 a Beijing furniture city fire caused 13 thousand square meters of steel structure collapsed in Qingdao in 2003; a food processing plant fire, steel roof collapse in dozens of employees failed to timely evacuation of death; --- so do the fire protection of steel structure work, to ensure the safety of life and property, has very important practical significance to prevent the occurrence malignant accident.
图2 火灾下钢结构失效（以上图示）	Fig. 2 failure of steel structure under fire (pictured above)
三、建筑防火设计规范明确要求	Three, building fire protection design specification clearly requirements
鉴于近年来的火灾教训，2015年出台了新版《建筑防火设计规范》，在规范修订时取消了钢结构等金属结构件可以不采取防火保护措施的有关规定，也就是说从2015年5月1日新规执行开始，所有的钢结构等金属构件均需使用防火保护。	In view of the fire lessons in recent years, in 2015 introduced the new edition of "building fire protection design standard", the relevant provisions in the revised specification to cancel the steel and other metal structure can not adopt the fire protection measures, namely from May 1, 2015 began the implementation of new regulations, steel and other metal components all required the use of fire protection.
目前在钢构建筑防火保护上，仍有大量的建筑并未按新规执行，对金属构件进行防火保护处理，也就是说是违反规范及标准规定的。如若该类建筑因意外发生火灾事故，则设计及施工单位则需罪责难逃了。规范变了，不管设计或者是施工单位都应及时跟进新规范及标准要求。	At present, there are still a large number of buildings not implemented in accordance with the new regulations, fire protection treatment of metal components, that is to say, in violation of the norms and standards. If this kind of buildings due to accidental fire accident, then the design and construction units should be held accountable. Standard changes, regardless of the design or construction units should promptly follow the new norms and standards requirements.
图3：2015版新《建筑防火设计规范》	Figure 3:2015 new edition code for design of building fire protection
图4：2006版旧《建筑防火设计规范》，已失效	The old version of "code for building fire protection design" of 4:2006 edition has been invalid
图5：新规范关于钢结构建筑防火设计部分解读	Figure 5: Interpretation of the new code on fire protection design of steel structure
四、钢结构建筑的防火保护	Four. Fire protection of steel structure building
钢结构建筑的防火措施分为主动防火和被动防火。主动防火主要指结合火灾探测而进行的主动灭火措施，改变火灾现场的行为，如喷淋装置和消防员的灭火行为等；被动防火主要指在结构设计和构造措施上采取合理措施，提高结构的抗火性能，并不改变火灾火场。主要介绍下被动防火保护，被动防火保护主要分为以下5类：	The fire prevention measures of steel structure building are divided into active fire protection and passive fire protection. Active fire extinguishing measures mainly refers to the initiative with fire detection and fire scene change behavior, such as sprinklers and firemen fire behavior; passive fire protection mainly refers to take reasonable measures and structural measures in the design of structure, improve the structure of the fire resistance, fire fire does not change. Passive fire protection is mainly introduced, passive fire protection is mainly divided into the following 5 categories:
1）包敷法防火	1) fire prevention by wrapping
包敷法主要是用固体耐火的材料将钢结构整体彻底包起来。固体的耐火材料不但有不燃性，还有较大热容量，将它用作耐火的保护层就能让构件升温减缓。目前，工程中一般多采用无机防火板，比如使用硅酸钙板、石膏板、蛭石板等。此方法主要用于形状规则的梁、柱等构件、对落灰洁净度要求极高的制药车间以及低、多层轻钢结构房屋中。	Wrapping method is mainly to use solid refractory material to completely wrap up the steel structure as a whole. Solid refractories are not only nonflammable, but also have higher thermal capacity, which can be used as fire-resistant protective layer to slow down the temperature rise of components. At present, inorganic flame retardant boards are usually used in engineering, such as calcium silicate board, gypsum board, vermiculite slab, etc.. This method is mainly used in the shape of regular beams, columns and other components, the ash cleaning cleanliness of the pharmaceutical workshop and low and multi-storey light steel structure housing.
图6 包封法防火案例（以上图示）	Figure 6 fire proof case (pictured above)
2）喷涂法防火	2) fire protection by spraying
所谓的喷涂法，就是在钢结构的表面上涂一层防火的涂料，进而让钢结构上形成一层保护膜，利用材料本身的防火性或者发泡产生的致密绝热、隔热保护层，延缓钢结构温升时间，提高钢结构构件的耐火极限。	Spraying method called, is on the surface of the steel structure is coated with a layer of fireproof coating, to form a layer of protective film on the steel structure, the use of compact heat insulation, fire-resistant or produce foam heat insulation protection layer of the material itself, slow temperature rise time of steel structure, steel structure to improve the fire resistance limit of parts.
图7 防火涂料施工及喷涂后效果（以上图示）	Figure 7 fire retardant coating construction and the effect after spraying (pictured above)
按不同方式，防火涂料的分类如下图8所示。在工程开发应用中，主要按涂层厚度分为厚涂型防火涂料、薄涂型防火涂料及超薄型防火涂料。	According to different ways, the classification of fire retardant coating is shown in figure 8. In engineering development, it is divided into thick coating fireproof coating, thin coating fire retardant coating and ultra-thin fireproof coating according to coating thickness.
图8 钢结构防火涂料分类（以上图示）	Figure 8 classification of fire retardant coatings for steel structures (pictured above)
表1 不同防火涂料性能	Table 1 performance of different fire retardant coatings
由上表可知，在工程应用时，防护时间2小时以上时，如高层建筑中的钢柱，只能选用厚涂型，其它情况可以根据项目情况选择厚、薄或者超薄型喷涂。由于组成材料的不同，薄涂型、超薄型防火涂料在火	From the above table, in engineering application, when the protection time is more than 2 hours, such as high-rise building steel column, can only choose thick coating type, other circumstances can be selected according to the project thick, thin or ultra-thin type of spraying. Due to the different composition of the material, thin coating type, ultra-thin fire retardant coating in the fire

Outward report : end-of-year U . S . shopping mall rules big difference shopping return to be cautious
China New Network on December 29
As soon as Christmas was over , there was a wave of returns , according to the U . S . World Daily .
More than half of the goods sold last Christmas were replaced , ABC reported .
In addition , a number of readers have been cheated , consumers in the informal website shopping needs to pay more attention .
Generally speaking , large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures , but if you buy gifts or electricity from some small shops , you must be careful .
Ms . Hou of Roland Gunn bought a coat for more than 60 yuan ( US dollars , the same below ) at an online shop selling print coats on December 1 local time , and it hasn't arrived yet .
She sent an e-mail to the customer service , and there was no reply .
Another netizen went on a trip to the United States last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller , and sent it to find it was a box of rubber mud .
When you know you have been cheated , apply for a refund to the website and get a full refund .
But some customers also believe that the website refund service is not 100 % perfect .
Mr . Wang , a Chinese-American resident of Northern California , said he had twice purchased an urgent delivery service for a Web site and four yuan for an urgent service , but neither had been delivered on time .
And then apply for a refund , also did not get a reply .
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy .
Most of Macy's products are refunded in full within 180 days .

If there are no vouchers , customers can also get store points , which can be used to buy other goods .

Extreme shopping experience , the advent of a new era of business circle shopping development
More than a decade ago , our country is still in the seller's market in general , people's choice is limited , the demand is also limited .
But after a decade of development , the market has shifted from the seller's market to the buyer's market . Today's consumer tastes have become more sophisticated , and they are no longer content with simple " hand-in-hand " shopping .
Therefore , how to let consumers get an extreme shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers .
And among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience , the shopping center in the business circle has the most significant influence .
See how city builders everywhere pay attention to the shopping experience .
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world , no two exactly the same shopping centers , a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics .
Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping center , for example , has its unique wave-shaped architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon , so Kanyon , a homonym , walks through the 200 - meter walk of Kanyon's minister , as if it were in the Grand Canyon .
In addition to the canyon-style design , in the center of the shopping centre , there is a large oval-shaped performance venue with a unique shape and often features performances .
Because of the open platform design , visitors can walk on each floor to look at the activities carried out in the " canyon " , and have the effect of changing the scene step by step .
At home , Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street , known as China's first forest stroll , combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales .
The 7000 - square-meter green plaza , the 3,000 - square-meter roof water platform , is composed of nine single buildings . The buildings are connected with each other in the air , and the whole sunken courtyard is designed to create a forest-like feeling by taking the French sycamore tree as the building epidermis and the roof water roof .
Walking into the forest moles , it was like accidentally falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's adventures , climbing along the trunk of the tree to surround the building , the grass , the clear spring , and bring people into the forest full of vitality and vigor .
It also plans to introduce more than 50 top international monopoly flagship stores , more than 100 top international brands and more than 500 well-known domestic and foreign brands in the future , so as to create a business center with a distinctive theme and concentration of service industries .
Not only that , it also integrates the ecology into the building , taking TOD public transport as the guide , integrating fashion shopping , life services , catering , entertainment , education and sports . It also leads the consumers to enjoy the unique " waterfront culture " of Chongqing while providing them with the ultimate shopping experience . It is a perfect combination of shopping and water entertainment and recreation .
It can be found that at present , a number of housing companies have seen the discovery of this new urban business trajectory , and industry insiders say that this consumer experience-centered , how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development .
Today's business circle is not only the distribution of goods , more is the integration of art culture , creative theme of the complex , but also bearing people's responsibility to live in the city .
Therefore , while satisfying the needs of consumers to eat , drink and buy one-stop material , maximizing the transmission of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs , giving full play to the livable residential demand , is bound to be the high point of the future development of the business circle .
In Chongqing , Guoxing's northern bank , Jiangshan , is located in the north of the river , near the Guanyin Bridge , bringing together the world's commercial essence , international giants around the ring , first-class brands gathered to connect with the international fashion .
Here step-by-step prosperity , gather the essence of the world ;
Dongyuan Jin Yue has a better shopping environment , Dongyuan Jin Yue near the Nanping business circle , enjoy the west and even the country's leading four-storey three-dimensional transportation system , to enhance the shopping comfort .
In addition , the landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of Huidong Road and Wanda Square has been upgraded , about 300 trees have been planted , 40,000 square meters have been renovated , and the image of the Nanping commercial circle has been improved .
Longhu Lake One , near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront , is surrounded by nine parks , with low density and high openness , making people more willing to stay , stop and enjoy the fun of shopping , rather than being hurried forward by the crowds behind them .
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more fierce , how to kill a bloody road in the same-quality market , to win the future consumer's reputation as a " shopping mecca " , it is worth all real estate developers to think seriously .
Differentiation strategy alone is far from enough , only those developers who really put consumers in their hearts , anxious consumers , want consumers to think , to provide consumers with the ultimate and simple shopping experience can laugh in the storm-hit market .
Of course , in the end , I think the most happy people in Chongqing , with such a good shopping experience and business circle , 10 years ago no one can imagine the prosperity of today .
Matter Festival : Consumerist revelry to cover up real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan , this is November 11 , 2017 , " Sky Cat Double Eleven Global Carnival " 24 hours , day cat users spend the amount of transaction .
Specifically , after the start of the " double 11 " , in just three minutes , the cat turnover exceeded 10 billion yuan , 6 minutes and 05 seconds more than 20 billion yuan , 9 hours broken 100 billion yuan .
On this day , the total number of payments made by consumers around the world through PayPal reached 1.48 billion , up 41 % from last year .
These consumption will bring 812 million logistics orders .
And whether it is the sky cat net purchase platform or pay treasure payment platform , all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group .
Ten years ago , no one would have thought that the " Singles Day " subculture created by single young people out of self-mockery on November 11 would be compiled by telemarketers and become today's phenomenon-class " Double 11 " shopping carnival .
On November 11 , 2009 , Alibaba first used the " Singles Day promotion " marketing gimmick : No one is in love with you , so " single dogs " come online to buy it .
The results were surprising , with Taobao Mall trading more than 52 million yuan a day , 10 times the amount of daily transactions at the time .
Since then , " double 11 " has become Alibaba-made shopping carnival , from the beginning of domestic buyers to amuse themselves , to the current influx of businesses around the world , nine years later , the cat " double 11 " million transactions have been more than 3200 times that year , making " Black Friday " dust-free .
Following the wind day cat " double eleven " promotion , there are a lot of electricity business , among them " Jingdong " is the strongest .
" Jingdong " has its own shopping festival " 6.18 " , but there is no " double 11 " impact , this year from November 1 to 11 , " Jingdong " accumulated sales of 127.1 billion yuan .
And " double 11 " , followed by a similar " double 12 " discount carnival , Christmas New Year's shopping season .
Across the New Year , waiting for Chinese consumers are also pre-Spring Festival shopping schedule , Valentine's Day shopping schedule , consumption , will not holiday .
The environmental problems caused by the mass consumption of instantaneous time have attracted the attention of professionals and organizations .
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph , at least 300,000 tons of garbage were produced during the " double 11 " period this year , according to the usual conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per pack in the industry .
Liu Hua , director of the pollution prevention and control program at the Greenpeace East Asia Division , told the Chinese and foreign dialogue that this year's " double 11 " cat orders will generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste .
The National Post Office issued a report in 2016 indicating that some 780 million pieces of express mail were delivered during the " Double 11 " period of 2015 ( 11 - 16 November ) , using more than 3 billion woven bags , 99.22 billion packing cases , 16,985 million metres of tape , and the length of the tape can be circled around the Earth's equator 425 times .
This year , the National Post Office estimated that the " double 11 " express business volume is expected to exceed 1.5 billion pieces .
Wang Shi , manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing , told Xinhua that more than 2,000 tons of waste were entered every day after the " double 11 " and more than the disposal capacity of the incinerator .
The express company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express industry is not negligible .
Some e-commerce logistics companies , including Su Ning , have introduced recyclable plastic express boxes before " Double 11 " , which can be re-used as recycling bags for shopping bags and garbage bags , but the acceptance of troubled consumers is not high .
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support " green packaging " and " green logistics " in the micro-blog .
This microblog has reaped more than 68,000 " praises " .
What kind of mobile payment do the Germans want ?
Zhang Dong Fang : The mobile payment war opened in Germany is not expected .
Micro-letter payment and payment of treasure but moved the battlefield to Europe , competitors have not changed , looting positions have not changed--the Chinese , this is also global ?
Where there is a treasure to pay , there must be a micro-letter to pay .
Under an agreement with Wiretard , the German e-payment service , microletter payments officially began landing in Germany in November and are gradually being laid out across Europe .
This foreign reunion of the two " villagers " took place in Europe .
PayPal and microletter payments have been singing all the way along the path of globalization .
For the globalization of China's mobile payment , Ariel consults " China's third-party mobile payment industry research report 2017 " to sum up in two ways : one is through strategic investment , experience export , equity and support foreign domestic mobile payment enterprises .
Second , through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad , the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses , thus changing the recognition and acceptance of China Mobile payment .
Indeed , the Chinese have the world .
With China's booming economy and a large population base , the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe is a tempting figure .
But this is also doomed , this time in Germany to open the China Mobile payment war is not expected .
Does microcredit pay and pay treasure simply move the battlefield to Europe , competitors remain the same , the position of looting remains the same--or the Chinese , is this also global ?
A more pioneering discussion is whether China's mobile payments will be able to expand its territory in Europe .
Take Germany for example .
The enchanted " New Retail "
Chen Xin Lei , Yang Kaihan : Amazon announced its foray into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers , both timing and motivation are well worth playing with .
In November 2015 , Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle , followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego .
At the beginning of 2017 , Amazon opened stores in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year .
Almost at the same time , Amazon announced that its Amazon Go trial operation , customers do not need to line up to the store , do not need to check out , enter the door sweep code , take the desired goods to leave , the amount of shopping will be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account .
As far as Amazon is concerned , it is a great surprise that in recent years there have been frequent movements on the physical store .
As early as 2007 in the " Open Letter to Shareholders " , CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open a physical store unless the following four conditions were met at the same time :
1 . We must be sure that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investment ;
2 . We must make sure that this new opportunity is of great significance to the whole company ;
3 . We must make sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market ;
We must make sure that in this market , we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation .
Bookstores and grocery stores , the most rickety of the two retail entities , were the first rivals to fall after the rise of Amazon .
Amazon announced its foray into the two physical markets as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers . Both timing and motivation are interesting .
Does Amazon's approach run counter to the guarantees in the shareholder's letter ?
Similar voices were heard at the other end of the earth . On the morning of October 13 , 2016 , Ma Yun , chairman of Alibaba's board of directors , delivered a keynote speech at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunqi Congress .
" Starting next year , Alibaba will no longer mention the term'e-commerce ' , " he said .
The era of pure electronics will soon come to an end , and there will be no e-commerce in the next ten or twenty years , replaced by'new retail ' .
The combination of offline and logistics will lead to new retail sales . "
For a moment , " new retail " three words as if by magic , by the industry people often hang in the mouth .
But what does " new retail " mean ?
If it's just a combination of online and offline , then the concept is not new .
In 2016 , eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest operators and estimated total sales of about $ 200 billion , with the largest 25 accounting for more than $ 15.9 billion .
Of these 25 , 18 are traditional retailers ( such as Macy's , Nordstrom , Target , Gap , etc . ) that have only started operating online in the past five years .
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan to take a stake in Su Ning cloud business , is also in sight .
Globally , retailers and electronics companies are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers physical , electrical , mobile and social media .
Is Ma Yun-ti's " new retail " more of a summary than a vision of the future ?
If not , what is the difference between a full-channel concept and a " new retail " ?
Perhaps the crux of the matter is not whether on-line and under-line will merge , but how to fuse .
Looking back at the retail industry over the past 20 years , the rise of e-commerce , like the rise of early discount retailers , has focused on price and convenience .
Relying on these two pain points , the telemarketers moved highly standardized products , such as books and CDs , from the bottom of the line to the top of the line .
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience , the telemarketers have extended their tentacles to other categories , and began to improve efficiency .
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong , " using the idea and technology of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the current total of about 30 trillion social retailers , so that the escalating consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively satisfied , making the whole process of commodity production , circulation and service more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and large data . "
Therefore , the electric merchant's road , is a surface light assets , the actual heavy assets of the road .
" Light " means that the burden of fixed assets , staffing and management processes is not as large as that of traditional retailing ; " heavy " refers to the need for huge investment in logistics , warehousing and so on .
The change of the logistics mode ensures the high efficiency of the electricity quotient .
According to the Chinese government network , Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council chaired the executive meeting of the State Council on April 28 . The meeting held that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important measure to stabilize the growth and adjust the structure .
The meeting confirmed that the departments concerned should work out concrete plans on the basis of scientific evaluation .
By the end of June this year , some foreign daily consumer goods with large demand for domestic consumers have launched a pilot program to reduce import tariffs and gradually expand the scope of tax-reducing commodities ;
In the light of the tax reform , we will improve the consumption tax policy for consumer goods such as clothing and cosmetics , and make overall adjustments to the tax scope , tax rate and collection links ;
Add and restore port entry duty-free shops , rationally expand duty-free varieties , increase a certain amount of duty-free shopping , so as to facilitate domestic consumers to buy foreign products in China ;
We will further promote the convenience of customs clearance and tax rebates for overseas passengers , and strictly implement the requirements for the voluntary declaration and tax payment of imported articles in accordance with the law .
To formulate inspection and quarantine policies to support the import of cross-border electricity suppliers , and to clean up unreasonable charges for import links ;
Accelerate the promotion of Chinese product brand promotion project , support entity store development , achieve online interaction .
Standardize the market order , crack down on counterfeit and shoddy , and promote the survival of the fittest .
Let the consumer can be comfortable nearby , convenient shopping .

On January 18 , Alibaba held a high-level dialogue session in Chongqing , announcing that by exploring a new model of " Internet + Poverty Eradication " , it would help promote accurate poverty alleviation and rural rejuvenation .
This is after putting forward the rural strategy , launching the rural Taobao project , on-line Xingnong poverty alleviation platform , the establishment of Alibaba poverty relief fund , Ali once again " added code " to the fight against poverty .
Getting rid of poverty is one of the most important national strategies in China today .
The total eradication of poverty has never been realized in China for thousands of years .
" E-commerce poverty alleviation is a new round of anti-poverty development innovative measures , is the realization of accurate poverty alleviation , accurate out of poverty an important grasp .
The central government attaches great importance to and points out that it can play the role of the Internet in helping to get rid of poverty , promote precise poverty alleviation , and get agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet . "
As a result , Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014 , along with large data cloud computing and globalization , and listed as Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years .
In the same year , Ali launched a rural Taobao ( Village Taobao ) project to recruit " village sophomore " in the countryside , leading farmers to get rich through electricity merchants .
In 2017 , Ali worked with the commercial sector to build an anti-poverty channel for agriculture and agriculture . At present , he has docked 13 provinces and 120 state-level poverty-stricken counties .
Ali platform spawned Taobao village , already has 2118 .
Of these , nearly 400 appeared in the poverty-stricken counties of the province and 33 in the poverty-stricken counties of 13 countries .
In 2017 , in Alibaba China retail platform , the national Taobao village sales reached 120 billion yuan .
Mr Zhang said that in the face of a national strategy to combat poverty , Ali had been thinking about how to use the innovative capabilities of Ali's economy , such as technology , big data and cloud computing , to make a new way out of poverty .
Among them , village Taobao is the main load-bearing platform for Ali electric merchants to get out of poverty , and went through a direct-selling Internet to get out of poverty new link .
In the planting link , the village Taobao and the ant gold clothing jointly carry out agricultural capital agricultural tools and small loan support .
In 2017 , of the 832 state-level poverty-stricken counties , ant gold clothing served 795 , providing them with convenient payment , credit and other services .
The rookie solves warehousing and logistics , the day cat is responsible for sales , Ali Yun's large data feed back to guide agricultural production , further improve the supply standard , quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products .
The development of electric business out of poverty requires not only products , sales channels , industrial planning , but also talents .
By offering e-commerce courses at Taobao University , Ali taught farmers standardization , quality and large-scale planting methods , and realized the combination of " help-the-poor " and " help-the-mind " so as to keep farmers out of poverty on a sustainable basis .
These courses already cover about 92 % of state-level poverty-stricken counties .
But " commonweal mentality , commercial means " the thought of getting out of poverty , also can guarantee Ali in the help-the-poor time to achieve " true help-the-poor " .
Ma Yun , chairman of Alibaba's board of directors , once said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages : poverty alleviation , poverty eradication and enrichment .
Poverty alleviation is to teach people to fish , to get rid of poverty is to teach people to fish , to get rich is to create a " fish pond " for farmers , so that farmers can have fish to feed .
Electric business-driven industry to help the poor , is to build fish pond .
In the industry help-the-poor , Ali and Shaanxi Luochuan cooperation to create the Luochuan apple industry anti-poverty model , has been the relevant departments as an example of replication and promotion throughout the country .
Ali electricity business poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by the decision-making level .
Alibaba as the representative of the e-commerce enterprises have been posted , through the online channel , to ensure that farmers increase production and increase income .
Some village sophomore and ant gold workers have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of electricity merchants getting out of poverty .
At present , the China Office of the United Nations World Food Programme , together with the village Taobao , in Anhui and other places to carry out e-commerce industries to help the poor .
Sina Financial News was held on January 16 by Zhang Li , director of the Institute of Electrical Businessmen of the Ministry of Commerce , and co-organised by the Ali Research Institute and the China Vision think-tank , the Third Congress of the New Economic think-tank , which was held on January 16 , and delivered a speech by Zhang Li , director of the Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce .
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues , that is , the body and use of globalization , and the stage of globalization .
In this way , many people believe that globalization has stagnated , and that many developed and developing countries , in the new stage , have different attitudes towards globalization , which is different from the model .
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization . What are the constraints on the medium-term phase of globalization ?
Restricted by the economic environment foundation , it is precisely because the economic base has changed the globalization has been restricted .
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 basically ended , after 2018 will enter a new round of growth period , the next round of growth must be driven by raw products .
Beijing's first fresh supermarket , 7FRESH , recently opened , with plans to lay more than 1,000 stores across the country over the next three to five years .
In addition to Ali's box of Ma Shengsheng , Yonghui's super-species , Su Shengsheng of Su Ning , Meimei's palm fish fresh and so on , " new retail stores " began to pile up , and in the innovative model and even the price of each other " call board " .
Fresh supermarket competition to upgrade , has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail field , where is the new retail ?
" We will quickly enter the country in 2018 . There will be a lot of shops in Beijing , Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival . "
Box Ma Shengsheng CEO Hou Yi on the 10th at the second new retail summit revealed the 2018 " new play . "
" From 2018 onwards , the box horse is not just a fresh electricity dealer , but a lifestyle supplier that satisfies the instant service of the consumer .
Under the core mode line is the drainage , the experience , the line is the real sale . "
Unlike the traditional bazaar , supermarket , box Ma Shengsheng in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and delicious " net red shop " , even some intermediary organizations hit out the concept of " box area room " .
On-line e-commerce platform and under-line retailers each have advantages and disadvantages , but consumers appear in a variety of channels , so both sides are trying the full channel mode .
Industry believes that in the context of the consumption upgrade , 2018 " box horse " stores will be more and more .
And the box horse from the original fresh continue to explore more consumer areas , foreshadowed in the new year , the retail market will appear more innovation .
" For example , the online combination of the business model , attracted the attention of consumers , all over the opening of the fresh supermarket is also a good call . "
" But no matter how much these relationships are said , no matter how ostentatious they are , I am willing to pay for them when it comes to whether you have brought a good experience to the consumer or not , " he said , adding : " I am not willing to pay for them until I have had a good experience .

American Media : Scientists at the Air Force Engineering University of China study laser satellites for the removal of space waste
Chinese scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up cluttered Earth orbits , destroy old satellites and their sky garbage , US media said on Monday .
Researchers at China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper on how space debris can be irradiated into smaller , less damaging pieces by using a space-based platform laser , according to a study entitled " Sky-based Laser Removal of Small-Scale Space Fragments Variable Track Model " .
Space waste has been a concern of international space agencies for years , and NASA has considered a variety of options to track , detect and remove man-made debris , the report said .
The ways to remove large-scale space debris include giant nets used to clean up and collect waste , as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit . Chinese scientists conducted laser simulations and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up the Earth's orbit .
" ( Simulation study ) provides a necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology in space-based platform , " the paper said .
A 2014 study by Lockheed Martin , the US defence giant , found that there are about 200 threats a day for satellites in orbit .
High-speed debris moving along the Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions , described by experts at the European Space Agency as a " deadly chain of threats " . High-speed debris has continued to increase over the past year .
Space is basically empty , but the space next to the Earth is becoming more crowded , and each satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth , and over time the debris will pile up .
The more debris , the more likely a satellite that is still functioning is to be hit by debris , thereby damaging or destroying a multimillion-dollar investment .
All space agencies have drawn up plans to clean up space waste in the future , the report said .
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and get it out of orbit . Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth . Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain .
For now , China has also come up with a solution to space waste , using a large laser to smash floating space waste into less harmful debris .
The installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean up space , at least according to simulation results , according to a paper published by a group of researchers at China Air Force Engineering University in the German journal Optics .
The only way to prove its effectiveness is to test it , and there are no plans for such a mission , but perhaps sooner or later someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space , the report said .
Once done , we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space rubbish once and for all .

China's household debt rate is closer to that of the United States than can not afford to buy a home is more terrible is not to pay the debt ?
Recently , everyone is talking about the recent changes in the real estate policy , is the real estate policy to be loosened again ? The land policy supply main body diversification , will let the house price decline ?
But when we were worried about real estate prices , about macro-economic regulation , and about the future of the real estate market , the People's Daily wrote again . Last time we talked specifically about the adjustment of real estate regulation in the People's Daily , and now the People's Daily is writing about a more serious topic than buying affordable housing . Is that even if you can afford to buy a house , you can afford to pay the debt ?
Today , let's talk about a more serious problem than buying a house : loan repayment .
1 . China's growing housing debt crisis
In November 2017 , the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center issued a report on the process of deleveraging in China in the third quarter , pointing out that the rate of leverage in the residential sector continued to rise from 47.4 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.3 percent in the third quarter , up from 48.3 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 3.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017 .
The debt ratio of the resident sector in the whole real economy has increased , and the leverage rate has risen faster .
Studies show that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans , accounting for about two-thirds of residents' liabilities , about twice as much as operating loans .
Among them , in consumer loans , housing loans mainly accounted for about 80 % of the medium-and long-term loans , but from an incremental point of view , short-term consumer loans grew faster , higher than medium-and long-term loans .
In addition , China's household debt rate only counts the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions , while Chinese households still have a lot of private loans , including borrowing money from relatives and friends , with large-scale implicit debt .
According to statistics from the Su Ning Institute of Finance , the leverage rate for Chinese residents was only 3 % in 1996 and 18 % in 2008 , but it has started to grow rapidly since 2008 , doubling to 36.4 % in just six years and reaching 48.6 % in the third quarter of 2017 .
Last May , HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of people across nine countries .
The report is aimed at " millennium " young people from nine countries ( born between 1980 and 2000 ) .
China's housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 is as high as 70 % , far ahead of Mexico ( 46 % ) and twice the level of the US target ( 35 % ) , the report said .
The figures tell us that one of the most likely problems is that the biggest potential " grey rhinoceros " for Chinese residents at this stage is likely to be out of debt compared to not being able to afford a home .
Second , why the housing debt crisis is the most serious problem ?
As we have analyzed before , although we have been saying that Chinese house prices are relatively high , but compared to other countries in the world , China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high , so not so high house prices can not afford to buy a house , I am afraid that many friends now have to ask the question is that you can still afford a loan ?
As we look at the real estate market around the world , China's real estate market , due to its late start , has not seen a major real estate crisis in addition to what we said earlier in Hainan , but just a decade ago the origin of the global financial tsunami in 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States .
The cause of the housing crisis in the United States was blamed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
At that time , in the golden age of the United States , real estate companies sold their homes to low-income people at a very low price in order to expand sales . At a time when the U . S . economy was doing well , the real estate market was booming , but not for a long time , as the U . S . economy stagnated , resulting in a decline in the income of home buyers , a large number of household spending began to decline .
However , the current state of the United States was an integral part of American household assets , financial assets and real estate assets . Almost all of the family assets of low-income groups in the United States were real estate , while most of the top 20 % of the high-income groups were financial assets , resulting in a higher debt ratio of real estate in the poorer households in the United States .
A serious fact is that these people buy their homes when the economy is better , so the amount of money they pay for their mortgages is also calculated on the basis of their better income . When incomes fall , the pressure on mortgage loans not only does not decrease , but even because some subprime schemes have become more volatile , so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis .
As a result , some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes are too low , so the banks begin to take back their homes , and when the banks take back their properties from delinquent homeowners , they sell them at very low prices , leading to a gradual decline in house prices in the region , creating a vicious circle in which more and more homeowners find their homes worth even less than their own loans .
A great vicious circle was thus formed :
" The economy is bad--incomes are falling--some people can't afford a mortgage--banks are selling their homes at low prices--house prices are falling--more people stop paying their mortgages--banks are selling them--and house prices are falling . . . "
The problem is more than that , because house prices continue to fall , people stop paying the house to the bank and you don't have any debt . If the bank auctions the house and you don't get the money you owe the bank , then you still need to pay back the money . Simply put , if you use the first 600,000 , 2.4 million loans to buy a 3 million-million-dollar house , and when the house goes down to 2 million , you don't have to pay the bank .
So , in one vicious cycle after another , the U . S . economy gradually collapsed , leading to the U . S . financial crisis of 2008 .
Therefore , at this stage , China's household debt rate reached a high of 46.8 % is a very need to be vigilant , this figure is still below the level of developed countries at present , but the beginning of the problem has begun to emerge , the country has repeatedly stressed the deleveraging problem since last year , this is a very prescient judgment , if the household debt rate is allowed to continue to rise , it will inevitably lead to huge financial risks , so it is necessary to prevent the emergence of financial risks .
So after the house is used to live , not to stir-fry the location , the state has accelerated the establishment of multi-agent supply , multi-channel security , rent-purchase and other multiple measures , further defuse potential risks .
For our individual family , we must give up the thinking of real estate speculation , buy a house according to our ability , to avoid their own family into a huge burden , only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development road . 6 .

The central price of the people's currency at 6.4401 depreciated 66 basis points in a row to suspend the upward trend
Macroeconomic Tencent Finance 2018 - 01 - 18 9 : 50 Sharing
Tencent Financial News January 18 , the yuan against the US dollar in the middle of the price of 6.4401 , the last trading day of the devaluation of 66 basis points , the end of the previous five consecutive rise .
The overnight market , the dollar warmer , the dollar index out of the V-word form , as at 07 : 30 Beijing time 90.8900 .
Almost all of the 12 Fed regions report moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018 and remain optimistic about the outlook for the year , according to the Fed's economic brown book .
Meanwhile , the U . S . unemployment rate remained at 4.1 % in December , the lowest since 2000 , and companies are expected to raise wages in the coming months .
Federal Reserve officials generally see tax reform as a factor in supporting this moderately strong economic outlook , with the Fed forecasting growth of 2.5 % in 2018 and raising interest rates three times .
Market figures point out that in recent days , the ECB's monetary policy tightening is expected to push up the euro exchange rate , the dollar index is falling continuously , and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar is corresponding to a wave of rapid rally , but for now , it is unlikely that the ECB will soon adjust its policy stance , after short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market will eventually return to fundamentals , and the RMB exchange rate will continue to run smoothly is a big probability event .
It is worth noting that as the market stabilizes its expectations of the renminbi , the attractiveness of the yuan's assets to foreign investors has become increasingly prominent .
The People's Bank of China authorized the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center to announce that on January 18 , 2018 , the central exchange rate for the inter-bank foreign exchange market was 6.4401 yuan , 7.8482 yuan for the euro , 5.7854 yuan for the 100 yen , 0.82399 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar , 8.9017 yuan for the pound , 5.1302 yuan for the Australian dollar , 5.1302 yuan for the New Zealand dollar , 4.771 yuan for the Swiss franc , 676.47 yuan for the Swiss franc , RMB 1 to 0.61399 Malaysian ringgit , RMB 1 to 8.8352 Russian ruble , RMB 1 to 1.9128 South African rand , RMB 1 to 165.95 won , RMB 1 to 0.57030 UAE Diram , RMB 1 to 0.58233 Saudi rial , RMB 1 to 39.3106 Hungarian forint , RMB 1 to Rmb0.5303 , Rmb1 to Rmb1 to Rmb1 , Rmb1 to Rmb2 , Rmb1 to Rmb2 , Rmb1 to Rmb2 , Rmb2 , Rmb1 to Rmb1 to Rmb1 to Rmb2 , Rmb1 to Rmb1 to Rmb1 , Rmb1 , Rmb1 to Rmb1 , Rmb1 to Rmb1 to Rmb1 , Rmb1 , Rmb1 , Rmb1 , Rmb1 , Rmb1 ,
A picture to understand : Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Absrtact : In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative attributes , the collapse of the digital currency has nothing to do with the " old enemy " -regulatory risk .
From the visual map , the Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin than the West , and the world's dominant countries are still watching the legitimacy of the digital currency , representing the " Black Swan risk " is still very large .
* This article is from Wall Street News , editor Wang Mu . For more information , please visit Wallstreetcn . com , or download Wall Street to see APP . *
Bitcoin prices fell below $ 10,000 on Tuesday , their biggest one-day drop in three years , following a spate of regulatory turmoil in major markets such as China , South Korea and the European Union , where the global digital currency , led by Bitcoin , has been bloodied this week .
In addition to the natural price correction triggered by speculative attributes , the collapse of the digital currency has also been linked to the long-standing " old enemy " -regulatory risk .
At this important juncture , Howard Much . net , a visual large data website , produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world .
As shown below , green represents the legitimate market for Bitcoin ; orange represents the neutral market , although it has not yet publicly legalized Bitcoin status , but there are no major restrictions on its use ; pale pink represents the restricted market , where local governments try to use digital money through red-line policy or regulation ; deep pink represents Bitcoin is defined as an illegal country ; and grey is a country that has not yet commented .
( Pictured above from the Howard Much . Net Visualization Team on January 15 )
The paper points out that the distribution of non-green color blocks in the picture shows that the traditional oriental countries have a more conservative attitude towards Bitcoin than in the West .
Russia is the largest country that currently defines Bitcoin as illegal , China is one of the biggest restricted markets for Bitcoin , and India is one of the biggest countries that has yet to comment on Bitcoin and has yet to introduce policies .
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin , that is , the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated .
In the Middle East and Latin America , there is a marked divergence of views on Bitcoin , and the distribution of color blocks in the above-mentioned areas is more mixed .
Among them , Iraq , Iran , Turkey and Brazil are legitimate Bitcoin markets , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Bolivia have some restrictions on their trading and use , and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken about Bitcoin .
Taken together , the data show that 99 of the 246 countries surveyed worldwide ( or 40 % ) do not impose restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin , i . e . , green and orange areas .
Seven countries ( or 3 % ) are restricted markets ( pale pink ) , 10 countries ( or 4 % ) define Bitcoin as illegal ( deep pink ) , and 130 countries ( or 53 % ) have yet to deal more with digital currency information ( gray ) .
This suggests that countries , which account for 53 % of the world's main body ( more than half ) , are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency , led by Bitcoin , and that the " black swan risk " of Bitcoin is still large , as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital money .
The article argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital money , and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement .
Although the " popularity " of Bitcoin has grown exponentially since last year , it does not mean that all countries are interested , some countries may be concerned about the threat of local currency , or more about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations .
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week , including China's efforts to crack down on the OTC's centralized service online platform and mobile App , while South Korea is still considering shutting down the digital currency exchange , which the European Union believes has not been widely accepted and warned investors about the risk of " losing their blood " .
From any point of view of regulation , acceptance / criticism and adoption , 2018 will be the year of the global central bank's digital currency .
Russia and other big countries criticized the legitimacy of the Bitcoin , in fact , to give way to the official issue of digital currency .
The BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city : making foreigners feel like " living in a new era "
Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years , but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern glamour city , according to British media .
The Chinese capital , with its surprisingly high-speed Internet , sophisticated technologies such as face-recognition software , has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy , making it one of the most exciting cities for exploratory foreigners .
" If I can succeed there , I can succeed anywhere in the future , " said German expatriate Clemens Seth , who quoted singer Frank Sinatra as praising the lyrics of New York City .
" If Sinatra lived to this day , he would probably sing about cities like Beijing , " said Seth , creative director at Traveler's Archives . " Living in this city will make you feel like you're living in a new era and will always be able to keep up with the trend , " he said .
" People generally have a sense of being at the center of something grandiose , it's hard to say , but it keeps a lot of foreigners there for a long time , " Simon Norton , who recently lives in Beijing , wrote on his personal blog site 4 Corners7 Seas . " They want to see what it's going to be , and they want to see it with their own eyes . "
The city's high-quality , high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make daily life easier than ever before , the report said .
" Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cash-free society , with the Internet integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones , making it easier for everyone to do a lot of deals , " said Andy Penia Fulert , now deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's Web site in Manila .
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions , and facial recognition software has become so popular that many mobile phone applications use it to make bank transfers and payments , get people into apartments and offices , and even use it to verify the identity of online car drivers , the report said .
Beijing also recently announced plans to spend Rmb13.8 billion to build an artificial intelligence science park , where more than 400 companies will settle , focusing on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometric to autopilot .
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China over the years . Participation in these celebrations is highly regarded by foreigners , and the Spring Festival is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the easiest festivals for foreigners to take part in .
" I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year and clean their apartments as well as the red Spring Festival couplets with New Year's greetings posted on their homes . On New Year's Eve , all family members gather together to have a big meal and then stay up until midnight to greet the New Year with loud fireworks . For foreigners , spending the night with friends and family is really an opportunity to blend in , " he said .
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing , but the language barrier in China and the convenience of communication among expatriates are easy to justify their incomplete integration into local culture , the report said .
" Some foreigners have been living in China for many years but have little experience with their host country , " he said . " If your initial attempt to reach out to the Chinese is not successful , it's easy to feel more comfortable with other foreigners . "
In these so-called " foreign bubbles " , foreigners mingle only among foreigners and do not touch local and local cultures . Foreigners huddle in their own communities , eat in Western restaurants , and only foreigners among their friends .
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin-easier than one might think .
" An hour or two a week of Chinese private lessons or an entry-level radio play should fit everyone's busy schedule , " he said .
Learning even a few classic short sentences can be helpful in shopping , ordering meals in a restaurant or chatting in a taxi .
The report says stubborn air pollution is also a fact of everyday life , but in recent years the government has tried to contain some problems .
Residents stress that it is important to go outdoors in warmer months where pollution is often lighter , using blue sky days as an opportunity to wander through historic alleys or explore popular Ritan parks .
" Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface , " Norton said . " You can find great artistic and musical activities , indulgent nightlife , historical wonders , ultra-modern business districts and ancient Hutongs . "
Will China lag behind if it does not build this type of warship ?
With the recent announcement of plans by the world's major naval powers to build new frigates , it seems that the frigate has become the focus of the naval attention of the major powers overnight . First , Japan decided to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defense budget , which led to a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate plan , followed by the recent announcement by US Lockheed Martin of the latest U . S . FG frigate plan .
With the launch of the latest Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017 , it marks the construction of as many as 29 of the 54A frigates , approaching the total of the 53H series of frigates , and since the launch of the first 054A in 2006 , the 54A has been built for 12 years , even around the world , with the number of such high-performance frigates built in the United States , with the exception of Perry in the 1980s .
And the reason for the construction of so many 054A is simple , that is affordable , easy to use , plus years of naval arrears .
054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years because of its high cost-effective and good combat effectiveness . Its 4000 - ton displacement , carrying a 76 - millimetre main gun , 32 - unit sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile launching system , 8 eagles strike 83 and a straight-9 helicopter , although it was built in 2006 , and the design time of the ship is very early in the world .
But this is , after all , a ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century , with weapons on one side , and its power systems and electronic radar equipment already far behind the world's mainstream frigate , such as Europe's same type of frigate already equipped with full-power propulsion , small multi-functional phased array radar , large-size helicopter deck , the time has come to develop a new model .
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic policy of our Chinese navy .
The future development of the Chinese navy is bound to become a blue-water navy , and the future is bound to go to the ocean . With the rapid deployment and display of force in areas closely related to China's vital interests , it is necessary to have a strong fighting capacity to ensure that China's vital interests in the region will not be damaged , so it appears that the new Hu Wei River will develop towards a large-scale and ocean-going development .
Looking at the positioning of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence , the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the U . S . Navy . In addition to the necessary offshore defense vessels , other major ships will form aircraft carrier combat groups or amphibious attack groups as needed .
The role of the new frigate in the future aircraft carrier battle group should act as the anti-submarine main force and the mid-to-near area empty position , in the amphibious attack ship strike group should act as the frigate type , then according to this demand the new frigate must have the strong anti-submarine ability and the good mid-range area empty ability .
Based on the above-mentioned positioning , we can boldly imagine the general appearance of the future domestic frigate .
First of all , there will be a significant increase in displacement relative to the current model 054A frigate . It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5,000 - 6,000 tons . The power system will adopt an integrated power propulsion system consisting of a QC 280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines , with a maximum speed expected to reach about 30 knots and a substantial increase in endurance ; As for the weapon configuration 76 mm main gun and 1130 near anti-aircraft gun should be retained , but a red flag 10 launch system will be added . Behind the main gun there should be a 32 - 48 unit red flag 16 modified and fish-8 common vertical hair system , which should be installed in the rear of the hull with an 8 - 16 unit large vertical hair system for the launch of eagles and new cruise missiles ; and if the main gun is equipped with a low-level radar system , it should also be used for the development of two-level radar systems .
As a result , the overall level of the new frigate will reach the top level in the world , even when compared with the FFG in the US .
Of course , the above-mentioned concept is only the author's guess on the domestic new frigate , the concrete how we can only wait until the launch of the new frigate , let us look forward to it .

China's self-driving tourism market size or more than 10 billion yuan in 2020
[ Abstract ] In the context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel , self-driving is encouraged by national policies and loved by more and more consumers .
But at the same time , the self-driving market , which is expected to break through the trillion-dollar scale , is also facing double challenges .
In the context of consumer escalation and the prevalence of free travel , self-driving is encouraged by national policies and favored by more and more consumers .
On the one hand , the development of the self-driving industry is not directly proportional to the market demand . On the other hand , the self-driving organizers , such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies , are facing a meagre profit dilemma . On the other hand , the infrastructure and services facing self-driving travel are still in the primary stage .
60 % of the total number of domestic visitors , the size of the market is expected to exceed 10 billion
In 2016 , the total number of domestic tourists was 4.44 billion , with self-driving accounting for about 60 % of the total number of domestic tourists , and the scale of the self-driving market is expected to exceed 10 billion by 2020 .
According to statistics from the China Travel and Transportation Association on the number of people traveling by car , the number of people traveling by car has continued to increase in the past five years , accounting for more than half of the total number of people traveling in China .
At the same time , more attention and support has been shown at the regional and national levels to the emerging field of self-driving . From 2016 to 2017 , policies and regulations related to self-driving , passenger cars and camping tourism have been introduced intensively .
In July 2017 , the National Tourism Administration , the State General Administration of Sports and other eight departments jointly promulgated the " Plan for the Development of Automotive Self-driving Sports Camp " ; in the same month , the Development and Reform Commission , the Ministry of Finance and other 14 departments jointly issued the Action Plan for Promoting Quality Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development ( 2017 ) , self-driving tours were highlighted .
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving tourism .
Self-driving tour club profit is meager , complete industrial chain is the key
Although the domestic self-driving market potential is huge , the national policy is actively guided , but the self-driving industry is still in the primary stage .
According to the China Annual Development Report 2016 - 2017 , there are thousands of self-driving clubs , car clubs and car clubs in China , but the proportion of tourists who arrange their own travel by themselves accounts for the majority , with only about 15 percent of the total number of visitors participating in auto-driving clubs , self-driving clubs and other organizations .
At the same time , there are only a few online travel enterprises and traditional travel agencies that develop their own self-driving products . Many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products provided by some suppliers , and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers .
From the organization of self-driving activities , covered " eat , live , travel , travel , purchase , entertainment " many aspects , high degree of fragmentation , upstream supply chain heavy , tourists consumption randomness .
Li Guanjie , founder and CEO of the Beijing World Auto Club , believes that the self-driving club is essentially similar to the travel agency . In the early days , the main profit model was based on off-line activities , and the core point is the self-driving line products and tour leader services .
But now in the field of self-driving tour line product homogenization is serious , the tour leader service level is uneven , the self-driving tour club is facing the need of re-transformation .
It can be seen that the self-driving tour itself is not an independent industry , but with its self-driving displacement characteristics to form a cross-region , industry ecological circle , forming a complete industrial chain is very important .
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption , experience is a more important consumption element .
Therefore , for the development of self-driving industry , we should enhance the experience characteristics , develop the " self-driving + " theme and the IP of self-driving products .
Scenic roads are not only roads , but car camps should not only meet food and lodging
In the face of the rise of self-driving travel , the basic supporting development of self-driving travel is also relatively primary .
Li Guanjie pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not just a road , but the elements of transportation and tourism need to be integrated into it , but the road repair and tourism itself are responsible for the two departments , the transport sector to increase the tourism elements , but also stay in the construction of toilet , consultation center , propaganda column and other facilities , and the integration of tourism is not high .
Compared with the well-known self-driving route " United States 66 Highway " , the construction experience is worth reference .
The scenic route design is no longer the most direct and fast route between the point of departure and the destination , but follows the design concept of " experience driving fun " to provide the best enjoyment for self-driving visitors to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the road . The scenic route can link the point-shaped and face-shaped tourism landscape , preserving the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route , as well as organizing various thematic activities to enhance the participation and recreation experience of tourists and create economic benefits for local tourism .
In addition to the scenic road , the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving tour .
But the new Beijing News reporter knows that among the self-driving tourists , there are not many consumers who choose to stay in the camp .
In their view , many camps tend to be infrastructure-oriented and can only meet the needs of food and shelter , low-grade , single-product , and self-driving , which contains a lot of elements .
Some people in the industry who do not want to be named said that in the past few years , many of the enterprises that do camp are to take the land , take the land , the later supporting infrastructure construction and services have not kept up , operating conditions are a lot of losses , and there is no late capital injection , it is difficult to do some corresponding supporting products .
Consumers
According to data released by the China Travel and Transportation Association in 2017 , self-driving groups are concentrated at 21 - 40 years of age , especially at 31 - 40 years of age , which has a certain economic base and a high demand for personalized tourism , and are mostly parent-child tourists .
From the accommodation survey , self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation .
From the type of self-driving tour , peripheral self-driving is the main type of self-driving , accounting for 84.32 % .
Outbound self-driving is the yearning of many people , but the ratio is still smaller .
At the same time , with the increase in consumer demand , tourists who used to like to drive " tourist attractions " began to change their minds , instead of " get off the bus to take photos , get on the train to sleep " , but pay more attention to the experience and process of the journey .
